## Concrete Examples

### Reel Opening Hook
```text
"Option 1 (Audience Reaction):
Show audience laughing, nodding, or applauding with voiceover:
'When I speak, audiences don't just listen - they transform.'

Option 2 (Powerful Statement):
Direct to camera with compelling opening:
'Most businesses are leaving 73% of their revenue on the table. 
Here's why...'"
```

### Reel Closing CTA
```text
"End with:

'Ready to transform your audience? Let's talk about bringing 
[Your Name] to your next event.

[Name]
[Title]
[Email] | [Website]
[Speaking Topics: Topic 1, Topic 2, Topic 3]'"
```

## Quality Checklist

For every speaker reel, ask:
- [ ] Does it showcase actual speaking ability (not just talking heads)?
- [ ] Is there variety in topics, audiences, and formats?
- [ ] Is the production quality professional and polished?
- [ ] Is the length optimal (60-90 seconds)?
- [ ] Would an event organizer want to book this speaker?
