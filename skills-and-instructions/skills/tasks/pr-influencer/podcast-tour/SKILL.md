# Podcast Tour & Guest Outreach

Design strategic podcast outreach campaigns that secure high-value podcast appearances, build authority through guest speaking, and drive audience growth through targeted podcast pitching and relationship building.

## Core Objectives

- Secure appearances on high-value, relevant podcasts
- Build authority and thought leadership through guest speaking
- Drive audience growth and brand awareness
- Create long-term relationships with podcast hosts
- Maximize ROI from each podcast appearance

## Mandatory Elements

### 1. Podcast Research & Targeting
- **Relevance:** Podcasts that match your expertise and audience
- **Audience Size:** Balance between reach and relevance
- **Host Research:** Understand host's interests and interview style
- **Episode Analysis:** Listen to recent episodes to understand format

### 2. Pitch Strategy
- **Personalization:** Reference specific episodes or host interests
- **Value Proposition:** Clear benefit to host and audience
- **Topic Ideas:** 3-5 specific, compelling episode topics
- **Credibility:** Social proof, past appearances, expertise

### 3. Follow-Up Sequence
- **Initial Pitch:** Personalized email with topic ideas
- **Follow-Up 1 (Week 1):** Gentle reminder if no response
- **Follow-Up 2 (Week 2):** Additional value or angle
- **Relationship Building:** Engage on social media, comment on episodes

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Value-First" Framework
1. **Research:** Find podcasts where you can provide genuine value
2. **Personalize:** Show you understand their show and audience
3. **Pitch Value:** Focus on what you'll deliver, not what you want
4. **Follow Up:** Persistent but respectful follow-up
