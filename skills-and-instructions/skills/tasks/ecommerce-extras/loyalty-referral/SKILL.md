- **Redemption Options:** Discounts, free products, exclusive access, cash back
- **Tier System:** Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers with increasing benefits

### 2. Referral Program Design

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Value Exchange" Framework
1. **Give Value:** Reward customers for desired behaviors

4. **Drive Growth:** Turn customers into advocates and referrers

### Loyalty Program Examples

  - Silver (500-2000 pts): Free shipping + 10% bonus points
  - Gold (2000+ pts): VIP support + 20% bonus points + early access"
```

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

## Concrete Examples

### Referral Program Structure
```text
"Referral Rewards:

When you refer a friend:
• You get: $20 credit when they make their first purchase
• They get: 15% off their first order

How it works:
1. Share your unique referral link: [link]
2. Friend uses link and makes purchase
3. You both get rewarded automatically

No limit on referrals - refer as many friends as you want!"
```
