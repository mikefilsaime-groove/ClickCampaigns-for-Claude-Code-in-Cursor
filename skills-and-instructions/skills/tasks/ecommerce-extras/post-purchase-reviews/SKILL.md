# Post-Purchase Review Collection

Design strategic review request systems that maximize review volume and quality, build social proof, and turn satisfied customers into brand advocates through timely, personalized review requests.

## Core Objectives

- Maximize review volume from satisfied customers
- Collect high-quality, detailed reviews with photos
- Build social proof for product pages and search results
- Identify and address negative feedback quickly
- Turn reviews into marketing assets and testimonials

## Mandatory Elements

### 1. Timing Strategy
- **Optimal Timing:** Request reviews 7-14 days after delivery
- **Multiple Touchpoints:** Email sequence (not just one request)
- **Post-Experience:** After customer has had time to use product
- **Avoid Too Early:** Don't ask before product is received/used

### 2. Review Request Sequence
- **Email 1 (Day 7):** Friendly check-in + review request
- **Email 2 (Day 14):** Reminder for those who didn't review
- **Email 3 (Day 21):** Final request with incentive (if appropriate)
- **SMS Option:** Text message for high-value customers

### 3. Incentivization Strategy
- **No Purchase Required:** Reviews shouldn't require future purchase
- **Small Incentives:** Discount code, entry into giveaway (if compliant)
- **Compliance:** Follow platform policies (Amazon, Google, etc.)
- **Value Exchange:** "Help others" framing vs. "Get reward"

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Right Time, Right Ask" Framework
1. **Wait for Experience:** Let customer use product first
2. **Personalize Request:** Reference their specific purchase
3. **Make It Easy:** Direct link to review page
4. **Follow Up:** Remind those who haven't reviewed yet

### Review Request Email Sequence
```text
"Email 1 (Day 7 after delivery):

Subject: How's your [Product Name] working out?

Hi [Name],

We hope you're loving your [Product Name]! 

If you have a moment, we'd love to hear about your experience. 
Your review helps other customers make informed decisions.

[Review Link - One Click]

Thanks for being part of the [Brand] family!

[Your Name]"
```

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Genuine & Appreciative:** Show real gratitude for their business
- **Helpful Framing:** "Help others" vs. "Help us"
- **Low Pressure:** Make it easy to say no
- **Formatting:** Clear CTAs, direct review links, personalized content

## Concrete Examples

### Review Request with Incentive
```text
"Email 2 (Day 14 - Reminder):

Subject: Quick favor? (Plus a little thank you)

Hi [Name],

We noticed you haven't left a review yet - no pressure! But if you 
have 2 minutes, we'd love your feedback.

As a thank you, here's 10% off your next order: [CODE]

### Review Collection Best Practices
```text
"Do's:
✓ Ask 7-14 days after delivery (after they've used it)
✓ Personalize with product name and purchase details
✓ Make it one-click easy (direct link to review page)
✓ Follow up once or twice (not more)
✓ Thank reviewers publicly

Don'ts:
✗ Don't ask before product is delivered
✗ Don't offer incentives that require purchase (compliance issue)
✗ Don't spam with multiple requests daily
✗ Don't only ask happy customers (get balanced feedback)"
```

## Quality Checklist

For every review collection plan, ask:
- [ ] Is the timing optimal (after product use, not too early)?
- [ ] Are review requests personalized to the purchase?
- [ ] Is it easy to leave a review (one-click link)?
- [ ] Is the incentive strategy compliant with platform policies?
- [ ] Will this system maximize review volume and quality?
