# Paid Advertising

Create high-performing paid ads including copy and creative guidance optimized for scroll-stopping attention, engagement, and conversions. Apply direct response principles from **Gary Vaynerchuk**, **Gary Halbert**, **Frank Kern**, and **Mike Filsaime** for maximum ROI.

## Core Objectives

- Grab attention in the feed instantly
- Create curiosity or emotional connection fast
- Clearly communicate core value or transformation
- Include strategic CTAs and conversion priming
- Design supporting visuals that amplify the message

## Ad Copy Structure

### Primary Text (Above Image/Video)

**Hook (First Line):**
- Must stop the scroll instantly
- Use specific pain points, bold claims with proof, or curiosity gaps
- Examples:
  - "I made $47,000 in 30 days using this one strategy..."
  - "Most marketers are doing this wrong (and it's costing them everything)..."
  - "The 3-word email that got me 2,847 new subscribers..."

**Body:**
- Brief story, insight, or setup leading to offer
- Paint the transformation with specific numbers, timelines, outcomes
- 1-3 short paragraphs max
- Use line breaks for readability

**CTA:**
- Specific, benefit-driven language
- "Get Your Free Strategy Session" not "Learn More"
- "Claim Your Spot (Only 47 Left)" not "Click Here"

### Headline (Below Image/Video)

- Clear, direct promise or benefit
- Use urgency, emotion, or outcome
- 5-8 words maximum

### Link Description (Optional)

- Support headline with additional context
- Reinforce benefit or trust
- Risk-free, proven, quick

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Facebook/Instagram
