# Local Location Pages

Create location-specific landing pages that rank in local search results, drive foot traffic, and convert local searchers into customers through geo-targeted content and local SEO optimization.

## Core Objectives

- Rank in local "Map Pack" for location-specific searches
- Provide clear, actionable location information (NAP)
- Build local authority and neighborhood presence
- Drive conversions (calls, directions, bookings) from local searchers
- Optimize for "near me" and location-based queries

## Mandatory Elements

### 1. Location-Specific Content
- **Neighborhood Context:** Mention nearby landmarks, neighborhoods, districts
- **Local Keywords:** Natural integration of city/neighborhood names
- **Service Area:** Clear definition of service radius or coverage area
- **Local Testimonials:** Reviews from customers in that specific area

### 2. NAP Consistency
- **Name:** Exact business name (matches Google Business Profile)
- **Address:** Complete street address with city, state, ZIP
- **Phone:** Local phone number (not 800 number for local SEO)
- **Schema Markup:** LocalBusiness schema with NAP data

### 3. Local Trust Signals
- **Google Business Profile:** Embedded map and reviews
- **Local Awards/Certifications:** Neighborhood recognition, BBB rating
- **Years in Location:** "Serving [Neighborhood] since [Year]"
- **Local Partnerships:** Mentions of local associations or partnerships

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Local Authority" Framework
1. **Geographic Relevance:** Every section ties back to the location
2. **Neighborhood Connection:** Show understanding of local needs
3. **Trust Building:** Local proof points and community involvement
4. **Action-Oriented:** Clear CTAs for calls, directions, bookings

### Location Page Structure
1. **Hero:** "[Business Name] in [Neighborhood/City]" + NAP
2. **Service Area Map:** Visual representation of coverage
3. **Local Services:** Location-specific service offerings
4. **Neighborhood Focus:** Why this location serves this area
5. **Local Reviews:** Google Business Profile reviews widget
6. **Contact/Directions:** Prominent NAP + map embed

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Local & Familiar:** Use neighborhood-specific language
- **Helpful Neighbor:** Position as part of the local community
- **Clear & Actionable:** Make it easy to visit or contact
- **Formatting:** Use location-specific headings, local landmarks, neighborhood names

## Concrete Examples

### Location-Specific Headline
```text
"[Business Name] in [Neighborhood Name] - Serving [Area] Since [Year]"
"Your Trusted [Service] Provider in [City] - [Neighborhood] Location"
```

### Neighborhood Context Section
```text
"Located in the heart of [Neighborhood], we've been serving [City] 
residents and businesses for [X] years. Whether you're in [Nearby 
Area 1], [Nearby Area 2], or [Nearby Area 3], we're your local 
[service] experts."
```

## Quality Checklist

For every location page, ask:
- [ ] Is the NAP consistent with Google Business Profile?
- [ ] Are local keywords naturally integrated throughout?
- [ ] Is there neighborhood-specific content (not generic)?
- [ ] Is the Google Business Profile map/reviews embedded?
- [ ] Would a local searcher find this page helpful and trustworthy?
