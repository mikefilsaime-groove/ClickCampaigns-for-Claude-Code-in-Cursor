# Social Media Content

Create highly engaging, direct-response style social media posts optimized for attention, relevance, and conversions. Craft posts for organic reach, engagement, and traffic/lead generation.

## Core Objectives

- Stop the scroll with every first line
- Deliver value, create engagement, or drive action
- Build connection and community
- Drive traffic and conversions organically
- Establish authority and trust

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Facebook

- Slightly longer-form with storytelling space
- Friendly, casual, emotionally open tone
- Multiple CTAs allowed
- Line breaks for readability
- Emojis acceptable

### LinkedIn

- Professional and aspirational tone
- Business storytelling and personal insight
- Minimal emojis (optional)
- Value-driven insights and lessons
- Career/business transformation focus

### Twitter/X

- 280 characters or short threads
- Strong hooks, polarizing takes, punchy lines
- Strategic line breaks
- Engagement language (reply, retweet)
- Brevity and clarity

### Instagram

- Captions support visual content
- Hashtag strategy
- Story and Reel scripts
- Engagement prompts
- Bio link CTAs

## Post Structure

### 1. Hook (First Line)

**Must stop the scroll:**
- Specific, bold, curiosity-driven openings
- "I made $127,000 in 90 days using this one strategy..."
- "Most entrepreneurs are making this $50,000 mistake..."
- "The 3-word email that got me 8,472 new customers..."

**Avoid generic hooks:**
- "Want to grow your business?" ❌
- "Tips for success" ❌
- "I've been thinking..." ❌

### 2. Body Copy

**Style:**
- Conversational, empathetic, persuasive, bold
- Inspired by Gary Vaynerchuk, Gary Halbert, Frank Kern, Mike Filsaime
- Speak to pain, aspirations, or values
- Short, punchy chunks (1-3 sentences per paragraph)

**Techniques:**
- Storytelling for connection
- Emotional tension and open loops
- Ellipses (...) for pacing and drama
- Direct insights and value

### 3. Formatting

- Generous line breaks and white space
- **CAPS** or **bold** for emphasis (sparingly)
- Avoid giant blocks of text
- Structure matters more than word count

### 4. Bullet Points

- Feature-Advantage-Benefit structure (implicit)
- Highlight pain points, outcomes, paradigm shifts
- Scannable value

### 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTAs:**
- Comment, Click, DM, Share, Tag
- Natural, not bolted on
- Prime action with emotion or insight
- May appear mid-post or end

### 6. Visual Cueing

- [Place Image] for visual suggestions
- [Insert Screenshot] for proof
- [Use Video Clip] for dynamic content
- Visuals stop scroll and support message

## Content Types

**Engagement Posts:**
- Questions and polls
- Controversial takes
- This or that
- Fill in the blank

**Value Posts:**
- How-to content
- Tips and tactics
- Frameworks and systems
- Lessons learned

**Story Posts:**
- Personal narratives
- Client success stories
- Behind the scenes
- Transformation journeys

**Authority Posts:**

## Examples

### Facebook Story Post

```
I almost gave up on my business last Tuesday.

My biggest client cancelled. My team was frustrated. 
And I was staring at a bank account that made me sick.

But then I remembered something my mentor told me 3 years ago...

"The business that survives isn't the one that never fails.
It's the one that learns faster."

So instead of panicking, I did something different.

I called my top 10 customers and asked them ONE question:

"What's the biggest problem you're facing right now?"

Within 48 hours, I had 3 new projects lined up.
Within 2 weeks, we hit our best month ever.

The lesson?

When things fall apart, don't retreat.
Get closer to your customers.

They'll tell you exactly what they need.

You just have to ask.

### LinkedIn Value Post

```
I've hired 200+ people in my career.

Here's what separates the top 1% of candidates:

They don't just answer questions.
They ask better ones.

In my last 50 interviews, only 3 candidates asked me this:

"What does success look like in this role after 90 days?"

That question signals:
→ They think about outcomes, not just tasks
→ They want to exceed expectations
→ They're already planning to win

Most candidates ask: "What's the salary?"

Winners ask: "How will I know I've succeeded?"

Steal this question. It works.

What's the best question you've been asked in an interview?
```

### Twitter/X Thread Hook

```
I built a $2M business with no ads, no funding, and no team.

Here's the 7-part system I used (steal it):

```

### Instagram Caption

```
POV: You finally stopped chasing "more followers" and started doing this instead 👇

For 2 years, I obsessed over the algorithm.

Posted 3x a day. Followed every trend.
Watched my engagement drop anyway.

Then I tried something radical:

I DMed my top 50 engaged followers and asked what they actually wanted.

The result?

My next 10 posts got 3x the saves.
My DMs filled with leads.
And I finally stopped hating content creation.

The secret isn't more content.
It's the RIGHT content for YOUR people.

Save this for your next content planning session 📌

## Guidelines

**Avoid AI Clichés:**
- Never use: "dive in", "let's unpack", "here's the thing", "game-changer", "unlock your potential"
- Avoid: starting posts with "In today's world..." or "As a [profession]..."
- Replace buzzwords with specific, concrete language

**Hook Standards:**
- First line must work standalone
- Must be readable in under 2 seconds
- Create: curiosity gap, bold claim, controversial take, or pattern interrupt
- Test: Would this make YOU stop scrolling?

**Formatting Rules:**
- One idea per line on mobile
- No paragraph longer than 3 lines
- Use white space liberally
- Emojis: strategic, not excessive

**Engagement Optimization:**
- End with a question when possible
- Make the CTA specific ("Comment 'GUIDE' below")
- Invite discussion, not just likes
- Respond to comments within first hour

**Voice Consistency:**
- Write like you talk
- Use contractions naturally
- Include personality and opinion
- Don't be vanilla—have a point of view

**Platform-Specific Dos:**
- Facebook: Tell stories, be personal
- LinkedIn: Lead with insight, back with proof
- Twitter: Be punchy, be provocative
- Instagram: Visual first, caption supports
