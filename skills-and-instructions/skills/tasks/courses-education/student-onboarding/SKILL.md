# Student Onboarding & Success

Design world-class student onboarding experiences that drive immediate engagement, reduce buyer's remorse, and set the stage for long-term student success and completion.

## Core Objectives

- Eliminate "Buyer's Remorse" within the first 60 minutes
- Guide students to their first "Quick Win" within 24 hours
- Establish clear expectations and a roadmap for the course
- Build community connection and a sense of belonging
- Maximize course completion rates and student testimonials

## Mandatory Elements

### 1. The "Golden Hour" Experience
- **Immediate Access:** Zero-latency delivery of login credentials.
- **Welcome Video:** Personal message from the instructor establishing rapport.
- **Success Path:** A visual 1-page roadmap of the journey ahead.

### 2. The Communication Sequence
- **Email 1:** "You're In!" + Login + Next Steps.
- **Email 2 (Day 1):** The "Quick Win" task.
- **Email 3 (Day 3):** Community invitation and peer connection.
- **Email 4 (Day 7):** Progress check and overcoming common hurdles.

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Aha! Moment" Framework
1. **The Hook:** Remind them why they joined (the transformation).
2. **The Small Task:** A 5-minute action that delivers a tangible result.
3. **The Reward:** Celebrate the small win to build dopamine and momentum.

### Engagement Checklist
- **Community:** Automated invite to private Group/Forum.
- **Gamification:** Points, badges, or progress bars for completion.
- **Support:** Clear "Where to get help" instructions.
- **Survey:** Collecting initial goals and expectations.

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Enthusiastic & Encouraging:** Build excitement for the journey ahead.
- **Authoritative & Guiding:** Provide clear, confident leadership.
- **Personal:** Use "I" and "You" to build a relationship.
- **Formatting:** Rhythmic, short paragraphs to maintain momentum.

## Concrete Examples

### Welcome Email Subject Lines
- "Welcome to the Family! (Plus your login details inside)"
- "It's official. Your journey to [Outcome] starts now."
- "Important: Your [Course Name] access and next steps."

### The 24-Hour "Quick Win" Task
```text
"Open Module 1, Lesson 1 and download the 'Success Roadmap.' 
Print it out and post it on your wall. Take a photo and 
share it in our community group. You've just taken your 
first step toward [Transformation]!"
```

## Quality Checklist

For every onboarding plan, ask:
- [ ] Does the student feel excited and supported immediately?
- [ ] Is the path to the first win clear and achievable?
- [ ] Are login instructions impossible to miss?
- [ ] Is there a clear "Who to ask" for support?
- [ ] Does the onboarding reduce friction to starting Module 1?
