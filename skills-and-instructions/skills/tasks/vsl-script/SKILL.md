# VSL Script Writing

Write high-converting Video Sales Letters (VSLs) optimized for direct response marketing using John Benson's proven methodologies enhanced with Caleb O'Dowd's layered persuasion principles.

## Primary Objective

Create emotionally charged, high-conversion VSL scripts that:
- Capture immediate attention with pattern interrupts
- Sustain emotional engagement throughout
- Overcome objections in real time
- Drive fast action and conversions
- Work as spoken dialogue optimized for video delivery

## Core VSL Structure (14-Part Framework)

### 1. Pattern Interrupt & Instant Hook
Open with a disruptive, curiosity-driven pattern interrupt that stops the scroll. Immediately call out the audience's inner voice or urgent problem. Write as if speaking directly to their deepest concern.

Example: "If you've ever felt like [deep pain], this short video might change everything…"

### 2. Amplify the Pain (Empathetic Mirroring)
Describe the problem with visceral, sensory language. Show deep empathy: "It's not your fault… you've been lied to… and you're not alone." Mirror their frustration, guilt, or shame to build immediate trust and connection.

### 3. Credibility Without Bragging
Introduce the presenter with humility and connection. Use a transformation story or moment of despair that leads into discovery. Position as a guide, not a guru. Make them feel understood.

### 4. The Big Promise / Core Transformation
Introduce the discovery, method, or system. Tease the transformation: what life looks like after using the offer. Avoid hard teaching—focus on emotional outcomes. Apply "New, Easy, Safe, Big" messaging framework.

### 5. Micro-Tease the Offer
Hint that something is coming that solves everything. Keep them watching with pattern loops: "In just a moment, I'll reveal exactly how this works…"

### 6. Agitate with Story (John Benson Style)
Use a short, emotional narrative showing the BEFORE state. Let the viewer feel the tension and frustration before revealing relief. End the story at the emotional peak—then introduce solution.

### 7. Reveal the Solution (Offer Setup)
Name the product, course, method clearly. Unveil what it includes, why it's different, and how it works. Use bullet-style visual cues (voiceover matches) to break down benefits. Apply layered persuasion to increase believability.

### 8. Stack the Value (Hype Without Hype)
Anchor the real-world value vs. what they pay. Introduce irresistible bonuses and stack their value. Use phrases like "if all this did was…" and "but it gets better…" Add emotional contrast framing: Before → After → Ultimate Benefit.

### 9. Testimonials / Social Proof
Insert placement for real testimonials with video/photo or stylized quotes. Use micro-narratives from customers to reduce skepticism. Apply "3rd party validated claims" technique where possible.

### 10. Call to Action #1
Direct ask to buy/join/download with a strong emotional hook. Use scarcity or deadline if real. Example: "Click the button below to get instant access while this is still available…"

### 11. Handle Objections
Voice the viewer's top 3-5 objections and knock each one down methodically. Integrate the guarantee here. Example: "What if it doesn't work for me? Here's why that's nearly impossible..."

### 12. Call to Action #2 (Stronger)
Reinforce the emotional reason to act now. Remind of key benefits and pain of inaction. Include visual CTA cues with countdown or timer if appropriate.

### 13. Future Pacing (Life After Purchase)
Help them see themselves on the other side of the transformation. Invite them to imagine daily life with the solution fully working. Use identity alignment and legacy payoff techniques.

### 14. Final CTA + Soft Close
One last offer to act now with a soft, no-pressure tone: "You've seen the proof, now it's up to you…" End with warm branding and name sign-off.

## Writing Style Requirements

### Dialogue Format
- Write as spoken dialogue—natural, emotional, and urgent
- Use sentence fragments, pauses, and emphasis to match spoken rhythm
- Include **bold**, *italic*, and CAPS for emphasis cues
- Every sentence must earn the next second of attention

### Visual Cues
Include slide change and on-screen text markers:
```
[VSL SLIDE CHANGE]
[ON SCREEN: Key benefit text]
[PAUSE - 2 seconds]
[SHOW TESTIMONIAL]
```

### Pacing Guidelines
- Hook must land in first 5-7 seconds
- Problem amplification: 60-90 seconds
- Core promise reveal: 2-3 minutes in
- Value stack: Build with rhythm, not rush
- Each CTA should feel natural, not forced

## Tone & Voice

- Empathetic but urgent
- Conversational but professional
- Bold claims backed by proof
- Confident without arrogance
- Direct without being pushy

## Deliverables

1. Complete VSL script with all 14 sections
2. Visual cue markers throughout
3. Recommended video length estimate
4. Optional: Text summary for below-video placement

## Examples

### VSL Opening (Parts 1-3)

```
[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Black screen]

[ON SCREEN: "What you're about to see cannot be unseen."]

[PAUSE - 3 seconds]

If you've ever woken up at 3am...

Staring at the ceiling...

Wondering why you're working harder than ever...

But your bank account doesn't show it...

This might be the most important video you ever watch.

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Photo of overwhelmed person]

I know that feeling.

The frustration of doing EVERYTHING the "experts" tell you to do...

Posting content. Running ads. Building funnels.

And watching it all... fall flat.

Meanwhile, everyone else seems to be making it look easy.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Here's the truth nobody wants to tell you:

It's not your fault.

The strategies they're teaching? They worked in 2019.

But the game has changed.

And if you're still playing by the old rules... you're going to keep losing.

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Personal photo]

My name is [Name].

And honestly? I probably shouldn't be the one telling you this.

Three years ago, I was $127,000 in debt.

My business was bleeding money.

I was one bad month away from having to tell my wife we were done.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Then I discovered something.

Something so simple... I almost dismissed it.

But it changed everything.
```

### VSL Middle Section (Parts 7-9)

```
[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Product reveal]

[ON SCREEN: "[PRODUCT NAME]"]

Introducing [Product Name]...

The complete system for [achieving transformation] in [timeframe].

This isn't another course that sits on your hard drive.

This is a SYSTEM.

Here's exactly what you get:

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Module breakdown]

[ON SCREEN: "Module 1: [Name]"]

Module 1: [Name]

This is where we [specific outcome]. By the end of this module, you'll have [tangible deliverable].

[ON SCREEN: "Module 2: [Name]"]

Module 2: [Name]

Here we dive into [topic]. You'll discover the exact [method] I used to [specific result].

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Value stacking]

Now... if I were to charge what this is REALLY worth...

Based on the results it's produced...

We'd be looking at $2,000 minimum.

Some people pay $10,000 for coaching to learn HALF of what's in this system.

But I'm not going to charge you anywhere near that.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Because I remember what it felt like to be where you are.

Struggling. Frustrated. Running out of options.

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Testimonial]

[ON SCREEN: Photo of Sarah]

Don't just take my word for it.

Sarah came to me 6 months ago. She was stuck at $3K months, working 60 hours a week.

Listen to what happened next...

[SHOW TESTIMONIAL VIDEO or READ QUOTE]

"Within 90 days, I hit my first $20K month. And I'm working LESS. This system isn't magic—it just works."

- Sarah M., Marketing Consultant

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Sarah isn't special. She didn't get lucky.

She just followed the system.

And you can too.
```

### VSL Close (Parts 12-14)

```
[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: CTA screen]

So here's the decision you need to make:

You have two options right now.

Option 1: Close this video.

Go back to doing what you've been doing.

Keep struggling. Keep hoping something changes.

Maybe it will. Maybe it won't.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Option 2: Take action right now.

Click the button below and get instant access to [Product Name].

Start implementing the system TODAY.

And finally get the results you deserve.

[ON SCREEN: Button - "Get Instant Access"]

Imagine where you could be 90 days from now...

Wake up to notifications of sales while you slept.

Check your bank account and actually smile.

Finally have the freedom you've been chasing.

That's not a dream. That's what happens when you have the right system.

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Final screen with button]

[ON SCREEN: "$X - Click Here to Get Started"]

I've shown you the proof.

I've shown you the system.

I've shown you what's possible.

Now it's up to you.

Click the button below and let's do this together.

I'll see you on the inside.

## Guidelines

**Avoid VSL Clichés:**
- Never: "Are you tired of...?" (overused, signals amateur)
- Never: Fake enthusiasm that sounds like an infomercial
- Avoid: Excessive "But wait, there's more!" energy
- Skip: Over-promising with no proof to back it up

**Hook Requirements:**
- First 7 seconds must create commitment to watch more
- Pattern interrupt: say something unexpected
- Create curiosity gap: incomplete information that MUST be resolved
- Test: Would YOU keep watching?

**Pacing Principles:**
- Vary sentence length: Short. Then medium. Then slightly longer to create rhythm.
- Use "..." to create pauses in speech
- New slide every 30-60 seconds to maintain visual interest
- Never go more than 2 minutes without a shift in energy

**Emotional Arc:**
- Start with disruption (pattern interrupt)
- Build tension (problem amplification)
- Release tension (solution reveal)
- Build desire (value stacking)
- Create urgency (close)

**Proof Integration:**
- Testimonials should feel conversational, not scripted
- Use specific numbers: "$47,327" not "almost $50K"
- Mix proof types: quotes, screenshots, video clips
- Place strongest proof before CTA sections

**Script Formatting:**
- [VSL SLIDE CHANGE] for visual transitions
- [ON SCREEN: Text] for text overlays
- [PAUSE - X seconds] for dramatic pauses
- [SHOW TESTIMONIAL] for social proof placement
- ALL CAPS for emphasis in voiceover

**Length Guidelines:**

⚠️ **CRITICAL LENGTH REQUIREMENT:**
**Default target length: 20 minutes (approximately 2,500-3,000 spoken words)**

This is NOT a short explainer video. A proper VSL requires sufficient time to:
- Build emotional connection and trust
- Fully agitate the problem
- Tell a compelling origin story
- Present the complete offer and value stack
- Handle all major objections
- Include multiple proof/testimonial sections
- Close with proper urgency

**Length by price point:**
- Low-ticket ($47-$297): 15-20 minutes minimum
- Mid-ticket ($297-$997): 20-30 minutes
- High-ticket ($997+): 30-45+ minutes

**NEVER create a VSL shorter than 15 minutes** unless explicitly requested. Short VSLs lack the persuasion depth needed for conversions. If your VSL is under 15 minutes, you're likely missing critical sections.

Rule: Higher price = longer VSL = more proof needed
