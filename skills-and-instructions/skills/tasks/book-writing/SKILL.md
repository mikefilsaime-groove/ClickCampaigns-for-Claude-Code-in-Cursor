## Book Writing Process

### Phase 1: Concept & Outline

**Book Concept Development:**
- **Core Promise:** What transformation will readers achieve?
- **Unique Mechanism:** What's your proprietary framework or method?
- **Target Reader:** Who is this book for? What's their current pain?
- **Author Positioning:** Why are YOU the one to write this book?

**Outline Structure:**
```
TITLE: [Transformation-focused title]
SUBTITLE: [Mechanism or promise expansion]

INTRODUCTION
- Hook: Story or statistic that creates urgency
- Problem: The pain readers are experiencing
- Promise: What they'll achieve by reading
- Credibility: Why you're qualified to teach this
- Roadmap: What's coming in each section

PART 1: [Foundation/Problem]
- Chapter 1: [Current reality / false beliefs]
- Chapter 2: [Why traditional approaches fail]
- Chapter 3: [The new opportunity]

PART 2: [Framework/Solution]
- Chapter 4: [Core concept introduction]
- Chapter 5: [Step 1 of framework]
- Chapter 6: [Step 2 of framework]
- Chapter 7: [Step 3 of framework]

PART 3: [Implementation/Results]
- Chapter 8: [Putting it together]
- Chapter 9: [Case studies / proof]
- Chapter 10: [Common obstacles]

CONCLUSION
- Summary of key principles
- Call to action / next steps
- Bridge to offer (if applicable)
```

### Phase 2: Chapter Writing

**Chapter Structure (Per Mike Filsaime):**

Every chapter follows this flow:
1. **Hook** (1-2 paragraphs) - Story, question, or bold claim
2. **Context** (2-3 paragraphs) - Why this matters
3. **Core Teaching** (60% of chapter) - The actual content
4. **Story/Example** (15% of chapter) - Proof and relatability
5. **Action Item** (1-2 paragraphs) - What to do next
6. **Bridge** (1 paragraph) - Transition to next chapter

**Writing Style Guidelines:**

- **3-5 lines maximum per paragraph** (mandatory)
- **Conversational tone** - Write like you're talking to a friend
- **Use ellipses (...)** occasionally for pacing and transitions
- **Bold key concepts** for scannability
- **Break up walls of text** with subheadings every 300-500 words
- **Include stories** - Personal stories, client stories, historical examples
- **Use "you" language** - Address the reader directly
- **Create open loops** - Hint at what's coming to maintain engagement

**Chapter Opening Formulas:**

1. **The Story Open:**
   > "It was 3 AM and I was staring at my computer screen, wondering if everything I'd built was about to collapse..."

2. **The Question Open:**
   > "What if everything you've been told about [topic] is actually keeping you stuck?"

3. **The Statistic Open:**
   > "87% of [audience] will never [achieve outcome]. Here's why you don't have to be one of them..."

4. **The Bold Claim Open:**
   > "This chapter contains the single most important concept in this entire book. If you only implement one thing..."

**Chapter Closing Formulas:**

1. **The Action Bridge:**
   > "Before you move on, take 5 minutes to [specific action]. This will set you up for what we're about to cover in Chapter [X], where we'll dive into [preview]..."

2. **The Summary Bridge:**
   > "So now you understand [key concept]. But knowing isn't enough. In the next chapter, we'll turn this knowledge into a practical system you can implement today..."

## Examples

### MVB Chapter Example

**Chapter 3: The 3-Step Authority Framework**

Most experts make this mistake...

They try to establish authority by listing credentials. Degrees. Certifications. Years of experience.

But here's what I've learned after helping hundreds of coaches and consultants build 6 and 7-figure businesses:

**Credentials don't create authority. Transformation does.**

Let me explain...

When someone is searching for help with [problem], they're not looking for the most credentialed expert. They're looking for someone who can take them from Point A to Point B.

That's why I developed what I call the **Authority Triangle**:

**1. Story** - Your journey that makes you relatable
**2. Framework** - Your unique system that makes you credible  
**3. Results** - Your proof that makes you trustworthy

Let's break each one down...

[Content continues with each element explained]

**Your Action Step:**

Take out a piece of paper right now. Write down:
- One story from your journey that shows you understand your audience's pain
- The 3-5 steps of YOUR framework (even if it's rough)
- Three results you or your clients have achieved

Don't overthink it. We'll refine this in Chapter 4...

**PART II: THE SYSTEM**

*"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."* — Archimedes

In Part I, you learned why most [audience] struggle with [problem].

You discovered the three hidden beliefs that keep people stuck...

And you saw why the traditional approach—[old way]—simply doesn't work anymore.

Now it's time to give you the lever.

Over the next four chapters, I'm going to walk you through my complete [Framework Name]—the exact system I've used to [result] and helped [number] of clients achieve [outcome].

This isn't theory. Every principle you're about to learn has been tested, refined, and proven in the real world.

Here's what we'll cover:

- **Chapter 5:** [First component] - The foundation everything else builds on
- **Chapter 6:** [Second component] - The acceleration strategy most people miss
- **Chapter 7:** [Third component] - How to [specific outcome]
- **Chapter 8:** [Fourth component] - Putting it all together

By the time you finish Part II, you'll have a complete roadmap for [transformation].

Let's begin...

## Guidelines

**Avoid Book Writing Pitfalls:**
- Never: Write academic, dry prose that reads like a textbook
- Never: Use long paragraphs (5+ lines) that lose readers
- Never: Skip stories—every chapter needs at least one
- Avoid: Generic advice that could apply to anyone
- Avoid: Chapters without clear action items
- Skip: Jargon and industry terms without explanation

**Maintain Reader Engagement:**
- Open loops at chapter ends to pull readers forward
- Vary chapter lengths (some short punchy chapters, some deeper)
- Include "quick win" chapters early to build momentum
- Use cliffhangers before major revelations
- Break up teaching with stories every 500-800 words

**Book Quality Standards:**
- Every chapter must deliver standalone value
- The book should be quotable—include memorable one-liners
- Frameworks should be visual and easy to remember
- Content should be implementable, not just informational
- Readers should feel transformed, not just informed

**Voice Consistency:**
- Maintain conversational, confident tone throughout
- Use consistent terminology for key concepts
- Reference earlier chapters when building on concepts
- Keep the same energy from Chapter 1 to Conclusion
