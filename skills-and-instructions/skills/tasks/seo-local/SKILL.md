# 17 Email Marketing Best Practices That Actually Work in 2024

If you're struggling with low open rates and even lower click-through rates, you're not alone.

The average email open rate is just 21.5%—which means nearly 80% of your subscribers never see your carefully crafted messages.

But here's the good news: the top 10% of email marketers consistently hit open rates of 40-50% or higher.

What's their secret?

In this comprehensive guide, I'll share the **17 email marketing best practices** that separate high-performers from everyone else.

By the end, you'll have a complete playbook for improving your email open rates, engagement, and conversions.

Let's dive in.

## 1. Nail Your Subject Line (It's 80% of the Battle)

Your subject line is the most important 6-10 words you'll write.

If it doesn't compel someone to open, nothing else matters.

**What works:**
- Curiosity gaps: "The #1 mistake killing your conversions"
- Specific benefits: "Add 2,147 subscribers this week"
- Personal: "{first_name}, quick question"
- Urgency (when real): "24 hours left: 50% off"

**What doesn't work:**
- ALL CAPS HEADLINES!!!
- "Newsletter - March Edition"
- Generic: "Check out our latest updates"
- Clickbait that doesn't deliver

**Pro tip:** A/B test two subject lines with 10% of your list, then send the winner to the remaining 90%.
