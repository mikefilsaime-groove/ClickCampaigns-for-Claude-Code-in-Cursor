# GBP Posts & Local Visibility

Maximize visibility in the "Google Map Pack" and drive local conversions through a strategic, consistent cadence of Google Business Profile (GBP) posts. This skill focuses on localized content that signals relevance to Google's algorithm.

## Core Objectives

- Increase Map Pack rankings through regular "Freshness" signals
- Drive clicks to website, calls, or bookings directly from the SERP
- Communicate offers, events, and updates to local searchers
- Establish local authority and neighborhood presence
- Boost CTR (Click-Through Rate) using high-intent visual content

## Mandatory Elements

### 1. Post Types
- **What's New:** General updates, blog links, or "Behind the scenes."
- **Offers:** Coupons, discounts, or limited-time specials with "Get Offer" buttons.
- **Events:** Workshops, webinars, or local community involvement.

### 2. Local Signals
- **Geographic Keywords:** Mentioning neighborhoods, landmarks, and city names.
- **Local Service Context:** Connecting services to specific local needs.
- **Visual Proof:** Real photos of local work, team members, or the physical office.

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Local Authority" Content Calendar
- **Monday:** "Monday Motivation" or Tip (Local Context).
- **Wednesday:** "Work in Progress" or Case Study (Neighborhood Specific).
- **Friday:** "Weekend Offer" or Community Spotlight.

### The Perfect GBP Post Structure
1. **The Hook:** Bold, localized benefit (e.g., "Best AC Repair in [City]").
2. **The Body:** 150-300 words of value-driven copy with geographic keywords.
3. **The Image:** Geotagged, high-quality original photo (not stock).
4. **The CTA:** Clear button (Call Now, Book, Learn More).

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Helpful Neighbor:** Friendly, approachable, and locally rooted.
- **Clear & Urgent:** For offers, use strong "Buy Now" or "Book Today" language.
- **Community-Focused:** Show that the business cares about the local area.
- **Formatting:** Keep paragraphs short; searchers are often on mobile.

## Concrete Examples

### "What's New" Post: AC Maintenance
"Is your AC ready for the [City] summer heat? ☀️ We just finished a full system tune-up for a neighbor in [Neighborhood Name]. Don't wait for a breakdown—book your $99 inspection today and stay cool all season long. [Book Now Button]"

### "Offer" Post: New Client Special
"🎉 NEW CLIENT SPECIAL: $20 Off Your First Service! We love being part of the [City] community. Mention this Google post to claim your discount. Valid for all new neighbors through the end of the month. [Get Offer Button]"

## Quality Checklist

For every GBP post, ask:
- [ ] Does it include at least one local keyword or landmark?
- [ ] Is the image original (not a generic stock photo)?
- [ ] Is there a clear, high-intent Call to Action (CTA)?
- [ ] Is the most important info in the first 80 characters (the "snippet")?
- [ ] Does it accurately reflect the business's current services and offers?
