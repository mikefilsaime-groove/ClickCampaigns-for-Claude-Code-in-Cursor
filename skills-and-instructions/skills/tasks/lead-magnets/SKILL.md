**Title:** "The 7-Figure Launch Checklist: 47 Things to Do Before You Hit 'Send'"

**Cover Page:**
```
THE 7-FIGURE
LAUNCH CHECKLIST

47 Things to Do Before
You Hit "Send"

The exact pre-launch checklist used to generate
$2.3M in product launches over the past 3 years.

By [Your Name]
```

**Sample Checklist Section:**
```
## PRE-LAUNCH (14-7 Days Before)

□ Email list cleaned and segmented by engagement level
□ Sales page copy finalized and proofread 3x
□ Checkout page tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop
□ Payment processor connected and test purchase completed
□ Affiliate swipes written and sent to partners
□ Social media teaser content scheduled

```

### Swipe File Example

**Title:** "The $100K Email Subject Line Swipe File: 137 Proven Subject Lines That Get Opened"

**Sample Content:**
```
## CURIOSITY-DRIVEN SUBJECT LINES

These subject lines create an open loop that MUST be closed:

1. "I made a mistake..."
   → Open rate: 47.2% | Best for: story-based emails

2. "The [topic] nobody talks about"
   → Open rate: 38.9% | Best for: contrarian content

3. "This changed everything for me"
   → Open rate: 41.3% | Best for: breakthrough moments

4. "{first_name}, can I ask you something?"
   → Open rate: 52.1% | Best for: engagement emails

## URGENCY SUBJECT LINES

Use sparingly—they work best during launches:

1. "Last chance: [offer] ends tonight"
   → Open rate: 44.7% | Best for: final cart close

2. "I'm pulling this down at midnight"
   → Open rate: 39.2% | Best for: deadline urgency

3. "Only 7 spots left"
   → Open rate: 36.8% | Best for: scarcity-based offers
```

## Guidelines

**Avoid Lead Magnet Pitfalls:**
- Never: Generic titles like "Free Guide" or "Download Now"
- Never: Vague promises ("Learn how to succeed")
- Avoid: Multi-topic guides that try to cover everything
- Skip: Long-form content that could be a checklist

**Title Formula:**
- Include a specific outcome or number
- Hint at the mechanism or method
- Create curiosity about what's inside
- Examples:
  - Bad: "Marketing Tips"
  - Good: "The 7-Figure Facebook Ad Template: Copy, Paste, and Launch in 15 Minutes"

**Value Perception:**
- Include "value" callouts: "Value: $297"
- Make it look professional (good design = higher perceived value)
- Add testimonials or results on the cover
- Include a "what you'll learn" section

**Bridge to Offer:**
- Every lead magnet should naturally lead to paid offer
- Include soft CTAs throughout (not just at the end)
- The CTA page should be valuable, not salesy
- Use: "If you want more help with this, here's the next step..."

**Consumption Optimization:**
- Design for 10-minute consumption max
- Use visual breaks every 2-3 paragraphs
- Include checkboxes, fill-in-the-blanks, or worksheets
- Bold the most important takeaways

**Format Selection:**
- Checklist: When there's a clear sequence or process
- Swipe file: When examples/templates are the value
- Guide: When teaching a framework or system
- Calculator: When numbers drive decisions

## Quality Checklist

- Does this deliver tangible, high-value outcome in 10 minutes?
- Is every section actionable and valuable?
- Would someone pay $47-$97 for this?
- Does this showcase deep expertise?
- Is this better than free content elsewhere?
- Does this bridge naturally to primary offer?
- Is every word polished and purposeful?
