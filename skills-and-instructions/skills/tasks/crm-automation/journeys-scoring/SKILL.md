# Lead Scoring & Customer Journeys

Design intelligent lead scoring systems and automated customer journeys that identify sales-ready prospects, nurture leads through the funnel, and maximize conversion rates through behavioral triggers and personalized automation.

## Core Objectives

- Identify sales-ready leads through behavioral and demographic scoring
- Automate nurturing journeys based on lead behavior and interests
- Segment audiences for personalized messaging and offers
- Reduce manual work through intelligent automation
- Maximize conversion rates through timely, relevant touchpoints

## Mandatory Elements

### 1. Lead Scoring Model
- **Demographic Score:** Firmographics (company size, industry, title)
- **Behavioral Score:** Engagement actions (email opens, page views, downloads)
- **Scoring Thresholds:** Minimum scores for "Marketing Qualified Lead" (MQL) and "Sales Qualified Lead" (SQL)
- **Negative Scoring:** Deduct points for unengaged behavior (unsubscribes, inactivity)

### 2. Journey Mapping
- **Entry Points:** Where leads enter the journey (form submission, webinar, etc.)
- **Stages:** Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Retention
- **Triggers:** Behavioral events that advance leads through stages
- **Content:** Stage-appropriate content and offers

### 3. Automation Rules
- **If/Then Logic:** Conditional automation based on score or behavior
- **Timing:** Appropriate delays between touchpoints
- **Personalization:** Dynamic content based on lead attributes
- **Suppression:** Rules to prevent over-communication

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Score & Nurture" Framework
1. **Score Leads:** Quantify lead quality and readiness
2. **Segment:** Group leads by score, behavior, or attributes
3. **Automate:** Trigger journeys based on segments and triggers
4. **Optimize:** Test and refine scoring and journey performance

### Lead Scoring Example
```text
"Scoring Model (Total: 100 points):

Demographic (40 points max):
• Company size: 10-50 employees (+10), 50-200 (+15), 200+ (+20)
• Job title: Manager (+5), Director (+10), VP/C-Level (+15)
• Industry match: Target industry (+10)

Behavioral (60 points max):
• Email open: +2 per open (max +10)
• Email click: +5 per click (max +15)
• Page view: +3 per view (max +12)
• Content download: +8 per download (max +16)
• Demo request: +20 (one-time)
• Pricing page visit: +15 (one-time)

Thresholds:
• MQL: 40+ points (send to marketing nurture)
• SQL: 70+ points (notify sales team)"
```

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Strategic & Data-Driven:** Focus on metrics and optimization
- **Process-Oriented:** Clear workflows and decision trees
- **Automation-Focused:** Emphasize efficiency and scale
- **Formatting:** Use flowcharts for journeys, tables for scoring models

## Concrete Examples

### Customer Journey Example
```text
"Welcome Journey (New Subscriber):

Day 0: Welcome email + lead magnet delivery
Day 2: Educational email (if opened Day 0)
Day 5: Case study email (if clicked Day 2)
Day 10: Product demo offer (if scored 40+)
Day 14: Sales outreach (if scored 70+)

Exit Conditions:
• Unsubscribe → Remove from all journeys
• Purchase → Move to customer onboarding journey
• Inactive 30 days → Re-engagement journey"
```

## Quality Checklist

For every scoring/journey plan, ask:
- [ ] Are scoring criteria aligned with ideal customer profile?
- [ ] Do journey stages match the buyer's decision process?
- [ ] Are automation triggers specific and measurable?
- [ ] Is there suppression logic to prevent over-communication?
- [ ] Will this system identify and nurture leads effectively?
