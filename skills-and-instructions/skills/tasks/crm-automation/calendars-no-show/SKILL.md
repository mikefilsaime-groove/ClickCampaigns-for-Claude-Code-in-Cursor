# Calendar Booking & No-Show Prevention

Design automated calendar booking systems with intelligent reminder sequences and no-show recovery flows that maximize appointment attendance rates and recover value from missed appointments.

## Core Objectives

- Maximize appointment show rates through strategic reminders
- Reduce no-shows through confirmation and preparation communication
- Automate reminder sequences (email + SMS)
- Recover value from no-shows through rescheduling and follow-up
- Optimize calendar utilization and reduce wasted time slots

## Mandatory Elements

### 1. Booking Confirmation Flow
- **Immediate Confirmation:** Instant email/SMS upon booking
- **Calendar Invite:** iCal/Google Calendar invite with all details
- **Preparation Instructions:** What to bring/prepare for the appointment
- **Location/Format:** Physical address or video call link

### 2. Reminder Sequence
- **24-Hour Reminder:** Email reminder with appointment details
- **2-Hour Reminder:** SMS reminder for maximum impact
- **15-Minute Reminder:** Final SMS with video link/address
- **Personalization:** Include name, appointment type, and value reminder

### 3. No-Show Recovery
- **Detection:** Automated detection of no-shows (no check-in/join)
- **Immediate Follow-Up:** Email within 1 hour of missed appointment
- **Rescheduling Offer:** Easy rescheduling link with apology
- **Value Recovery:** Alternative offer (recorded session, reschedule bonus)

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Confirm → Remind → Recover" Framework
1. **Confirm Immediately:** Reduce booking anxiety with instant confirmation
2. **Remind Strategically:** Multiple touchpoints without being annoying
3. **Recover Value:** Turn no-shows into reschedules or alternative value

### Reminder Timing Strategy
```text
"Optimal Reminder Schedule:

• Booking Confirmation: Immediate (email + calendar invite)
• 48 Hours Before: Email reminder with preparation checklist
• 24 Hours Before: Email reminder with value proposition
• 2 Hours Before: SMS reminder (highest open rate)
• 15 Minutes Before: SMS with direct link/address

SMS Reminders (Higher Impact):
• Use for 2-hour and 15-minute reminders
• Keep messages under 160 characters
• Include direct link or clear next step"
```

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Helpful & Reassuring:** Reduce anxiety about the appointment
- **Clear & Actionable:** Make it easy to attend or reschedule
- **Professional:** Build confidence in the service
- **Formatting:** Use clear timelines, reminder templates, and recovery flows

## Concrete Examples

## Quality Checklist

For every calendar/no-show system, ask:
- [ ] Are reminders sent at optimal times (24h, 2h, 15min)?
- [ ] Is confirmation sent immediately upon booking?
- [ ] Is there a clear no-show detection mechanism?
- [ ] Is the recovery flow automated and value-focused?
- [ ] Will this system maximize show rates and minimize wasted time?
