# Local Services Ads (LSA) & Google Guaranteed

Master Google's Local Services Ads (LSA) to place local service businesses at the very top of search results, earning the "Google Guaranteed" or "Google Screened" badge to drive high-trust, pay-per-lead phone calls and messages.

## Core Objectives

- Secure the "Google Guaranteed" or "Google Screened" badge
- Rank in the Top 3 "Lead Box" for local service searches
- Optimize the ad profile for Maximum Trust and Click-Through
- Manage lead quality through precise service and area targeting
- Maximize ROI by disputing invalid leads and optimizing budget

## Mandatory Elements

### 1. Verification & Trust
- **Background Checks:** Navigating the Google/Pinkerton verification process.
- **License & Insurance:** Ensuring all documentation is current and uploaded.
- **Review Strategy:** Maintaining a high star rating (4.5+) and recent reviews.

### 2. Targeting Parameters
- **Service Categories:** Selecting the exact job types (e.g., "Emergency Plumbing," "AC Repair").
- **Service Areas:** Precise Zip Code or City-level targeting.
- **Business Hours:** Syncing ad visibility with actual operational capacity.

## Structure & Frameworks

### The "Top of Lead Box" Framework
1. **Responsiveness:** Speed-to-lead is a ranking factor. Answer every call.
2. **Review Velocity:** Regularly getting new, high-quality reviews.
3. **Proximity:** Optimizing for the user's physical distance from the business.
4. **Profile Completeness:** Using all available features (photos, highlights, bios).

### Lead Management SOP
- **The 30-Second Rule:** Answer calls within 3 rings to boost ranking.
- **Dispositioning:** Marking leads as "Booked" or "Archive" to inform the algorithm.
- **Disputing:** Systematically requesting credits for "Wrong Service" or "Outside Area" leads.

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

- **Direct & Local:** Use language that resonates with homeowners or local clients.
- **Trust-Heavy:** Emphasize guarantees, licensing, and professional standards.
- **Urgency-Oriented:** For emergency services, focus on speed and availability.
- **Formatting:** Use tables for lead qualification criteria and checklists for verification.

## Quality Checklist

For every LSA plan, ask:
- [ ] Is the business eligible for the Google Guaranteed/Screened badge?
- [ ] Are all licenses and insurance documents ready for upload?
- [ ] Is there a system for answering calls within 30 seconds?
- [ ] Are the service areas and categories limited to high-profit jobs?
- [ ] Is there a process for requesting reviews from every LSA customer?
