# Email Sequence Writing

Create high-converting email sequences optimized for maximum open rates, click-throughs, and conversions using direct response principles from **Gary Halbert**, **Frank Kern**, and **Mike Filsaime**. Every email should feel like a personal message from a trusted friend who genuinely wants to help.

## Primary Objective

Create email sequences that:
- Maximize open rates through compelling subject lines
- Build genuine connection and trust with subscribers
- Drive action at strategic moments with clear CTAs
- Convert subscribers into customers through strategic persuasion
- Include a PS section in EVERY email to reinforce urgency or value

## Mandatory Email Elements (Per Mike Filsaime)

### 1. Subject Line & Preview
- Craft compelling subject lines designed for maximum open rate
- Include personalization with {first_name} when beneficial
- Complement with an engaging preview snippet that expands curiosity

### 2. Email Length
- Write to the ideal length required for maximum impact
- Long or short as necessary—do not force brevity or extend unnecessarily
- Every word must earn its place

### 3. Conversational Tone
- Adopt a friendly, approachable, persuasive, and natural tone
- Inspired by legendary marketers Gary Halbert, Frank Kern, and Mike Filsaime
- Write as if speaking to one person, not a list

### 4. Formatting & Style
- **3-5 lines maximum per paragraph** (mandatory)
- Use markdown: **bold**, *italics*, and underline for impact
- Use ellipses (...) occasionally for conversational transitions
- Include subheadings to guide readers smoothly when appropriate

### 5. Bullet Points (FAB Structure)
- Integrate bullet points following implicit Feature-Advantage-Benefit structure
- Clearly convey value, leading readers toward the "promised land"
- Naturally bridge features to ultimate benefits without saying "Feature, Advantage, Benefit"

### 6. Call to Action (CTA)
- Place clear, compelling CTAs strategically throughout
- Each CTA should prime readers for the next step
- Include multiple CTAs if it enhances message flow

### 7. Visual Elements
- Indicate image placements with [Place Supported Image Here]
- Place at natural points to support engagement

### 8. Personalization & Sign-off
- End every email with {first_name} personalization where appropriate
- Close with warm signature from brand owner

### 9. PS Section (MANDATORY)
- **Include a PS at the end of EVERY email**
- Reinforce urgency, scarcity, or exclusivity
- The PS should contain an additional strong call to action
- The PS is the second-most read part of any email (after subject line)

## Core Email Sequence Types

### Welcome Series (3-7 Emails)

**Purpose:** Onboard new subscribers, set expectations, and build strong relationship foundation.

**Trigger:** Immediately after opt-in

**Email 1 (Day 0): Immediate Welcome**
- Confirm opt-in and express genuine excitement
- Set expectations: frequency, content types, value
- Deliver immediate quick win or insight
- Personalize with {first_name} throughout

**Email 2 (Day 1): Value Delivery**

- Share story or insight that builds connection
- Introduce your approach or philosophy

**Email 3 (Day 2-3): Connection Building**

- Teach something valuable
- Provide actionable insight or framework
- Demonstrate expertise without selling

**Email 5 (Day 4-5): Community**
- Invite to community or resources
- Build sense of belonging

**Content Mix:**

**Value Types:**
- Educational insights and frameworks
- Inspirational stories and case studies

### Launch Sequence (5-8 Emails)

**Purpose:** Maximize sales during product launches through strategic persuasion.

**Phase 1: Prelaunch (Emails 1-2)**
- Build anticipation and curiosity
- Tease transformation and outcomes
- Create desire without revealing offer

**Phase 2: Open (Email 3)**
- Reveal offer with excitement
- Present full value proposition
- Stack value and benefits
- First conversion CTA

**Phase 3: Objections (Emails 4-5)**
- Address common concerns
- Handle price objections
- Overcome trust barriers
- Reinforce transformation

**Phase 4: Urgency (Emails 6-7)**
- Create genuine urgency
- Limited-time elements
- Final value reinforcement

**Phase 5: Close (Email 8)**
- Final emotional appeal
- Last chance messaging
- Strongest CTA

### Winback Sequence (3-4 Emails)

**Purpose:** Re-engage inactive subscribers through value and incentives.

**Email 1: Value Re-engagement**
- Acknowledge absence without guilt
- Deliver immediate value
- Soft invitation to re-engage

**Email 2: Understanding**
- Ask why they disengaged
- Show you value feedback
- Offer incentive for response

**Email 3: Incentive**
- Meaningful offer to return
- Limited-time opportunity
- Strong CTA

**Email 4: Final (Optional)**
- Final value delivery
- Respect their decision
- Leave door open

## Writing Standards

### Subject Line Formulas

**Curiosity-Driven:**

- "Why [common approach] fails..."
- "I made a mistake..."

**Value-Driven:**
- "Here's [specific outcome]"
- "[Number] ways to [result]"
- "The [method] that changed everything"

**Personal:**

- "Something I noticed..."
- "{first_name}, quick question"

**Urgency-Driven:**
- "Last 24 hours..."
- "This ends tonight"
- "Final reminder: [offer]"

### Email Structure

**Opening:**
- Hook in first line
- Personal and conversational
- Create immediate interest

**Body:**
- One main idea per email
- Short paragraphs (3-5 lines max)
- Stories that make a point
- Clear value or insight

**CTA:**
- One primary action
- Clear and specific
- Benefit-driven language
- Multiple placements for long emails

**Closing:**
- Warm sign-off
- Personal signature
- PS for emphasis (most-read after subject line)

### Tone Guidelines

- Conversational and personal
- Write to ONE person
- Authentic and relatable
- Confident but not arrogant
- Value-focused, not sales-focused (except launch)

## Guidelines

**The Mike Filsaime Email Rules:**

1. **PS is MANDATORY** - Every single email ends with a PS
2. **3-5 lines per paragraph** - Never longer, break it up
3. **Ellipses for pacing** - Use (...) to create conversational flow
4. **FAB bullets** - Feature → Advantage → Benefit (implicit, never stated)
5. **[Place Supported Image Here]** - Mark visual placement points
6. **{first_name} personalization** - Use in subject lines and body strategically

**Avoid Email Clichés:**
- Never: "I hope this email finds you well"
- Never: "Just following up" as an opener
- Never: "As per my last email"
- Avoid: "Don't miss out!" (overused, triggers spam filters)
- Skip: "Dear valued subscriber" (impersonal)

**Subject Line Rules:**
- Keep under 50 characters for mobile
- Front-load the important words
- Use personalization ({first_name}) sparingly—max 1 per week
- Avoid ALL CAPS (spam trigger)
- Test emojis—they work for some audiences, not others

**Formatting Standards (Mandatory):**
- **3-5 lines maximum per paragraph** - This is non-negotiable
- Use white space liberally between paragraphs
- One main CTA per email (can repeat it multiple times)
- Mobile-first: must look good on phone
- Use **bold** and *italics* for emphasis

**Deliverability Hygiene:**
- Avoid spam trigger words: "FREE!!!", "ACT NOW", "LIMITED TIME"
- Include physical address in footer
- Make unsubscribe easy to find
- Warm up new sending domains gradually

**Voice & Tone (Gary Halbert / Frank Kern / Mike Filsaime Style):**
- Write to ONE person, not a list
- Use "you" more than "I"
- Read it out loud—does it sound human?
- Be specific, not vague
- Have an opinion—don't be vanilla
- Tell stories that make a point
- Create emotional connection before asking for action

**Timing Best Practices:**
- Welcome email: within 5 minutes of opt-in
- Nurture: consistent day/time each week
- Launch: multiple emails during open/close windows
- Never send more than 2 emails in one day (except launch)

**PS Section Requirements:**
- Reinforce the main benefit or offer
- Create urgency or scarcity
- Include a CTA (link or instruction)
- Can repeat the guarantee
- Often the most-read part after subject line

## Quality Checklist

For every email ask:
- Does this deliver genuine value?
- Would a subscriber feel smarter or inspired?
- Is the subject line compelling?
- Is the CTA clear and specific?
- Does this sound like a real person wrote it?
- Would I look forward to receiving this?
