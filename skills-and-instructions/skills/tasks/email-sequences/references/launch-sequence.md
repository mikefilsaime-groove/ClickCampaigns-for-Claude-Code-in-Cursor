# Launch Sequence Deep Dive

## The Psychology of Launch Emails

Launch sequences are the highest-converting email type when done correctly. They leverage anticipation, social proof, and urgency in a strategic sequence.

## 7-Email Launch Framework

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Emails 1-2)

#### Email 1: Announcement & Curiosity (3-4 Days Before)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Something big is coming..."
- "I've been working on something for you"
- "Save the date: [Date]"

**Purpose:** Create anticipation without revealing the offer

**Structure:**
```
Opening Hook:
"For the past [time], I've been working on something behind the scenes.

And I'm finally ready to share it with you."

Tease:
"It's designed to help you [specific outcome] without [common pain].

I can't reveal everything yet, but I can tell you:
• It's something I've never offered before
• It's based on [credibility element]
• Early access goes to my email list first"

Build Anticipation:
"Mark your calendar for [date].

I'll be sharing all the details then, and I have a feeling this is going to be exactly what you've been looking for."

Close:
"More coming soon,
[Name]

P.S. Keep an eye on your inbox—I'll be sharing a preview before anyone else."
```
