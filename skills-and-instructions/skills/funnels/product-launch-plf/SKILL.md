# Product Launch Formula (PLF) Funnel

Build PLF funnels that create massive anticipation, build desire, and convert prospects into buyers through strategic pre-launch, launch, and post-launch sequences using classic Product Launch Formula methodology.

## Core Objectives

- Build massive anticipation through strategic content drops
- Create desire and urgency through launch sequence
- Maximize conversions during cart open windows
- Stack value and bonuses to increase AOV
- Drive action through cart open/close rhythm

## PLF Funnel Structure

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Content Drops)

**Content Drop 1: Problem Agitation (7-10 days before)**
- Landing page or blog post addressing core problem
- Agitate the pain points audience experiences
- Build empathy and connection
- Tease that a solution is coming
- Email sequence driving to content

**Content Drop 2: Solution Preview (4-6 days before)**
- Introduce your method, system, or approach
- Show how it solves the problem
- Provide value and build authority
- Create curiosity about the full solution
- Email sequence with case studies

**Content Drop 3: Transformation Stories (1-3 days before)**
- Case studies and success stories
- Before/after transformations
- Social proof and testimonials
- Build belief that results are possible
- Final anticipation-building content

### Phase 2: Launch (Cart Open)

**Launch Day Elements:**
- **Sales Page:** Long-form or short-form sales page
- **VSL or Sales Video:** Video presentation
- **Offer Stack:** Core product + bonuses + upsells
- **Urgency:** Limited-time pricing or bonuses
- **Social Proof:** Testimonials, case studies

**Cart Open Email Sequence:**
1. Launch announcement with excitement
2. Value stack and bonuses reminder
3. Social proof and testimonials
4. Urgency and scarcity (time running out)
5. Final call before cart closes

### Phase 3: Cart Close & Post-Launch

**Cart Close Sequence:**
- Final urgency emails
- Last chance bonuses
- Social proof reinforcement
- Objection handling
- Final CTA

**Post-Launch:**
- Thank you sequence for buyers
- Nurture sequence for non-buyers
- Upsell/cross-sell opportunities
- Community building
- Testimonial collection

## Sales Page Structure

**Above-the-Fold:**
- Bold headline (promise or transformation)
- Specific outcome subheadline
- Video or VSL thumbnail
- Primary CTA button
- Social proof indicators

**Core Sections:**
- Problem Agitation
- Solution Introduction
- How It Works (step-by-step)
- What's Included (detailed breakdown)
- Value Stack (core + bonuses)
- Social Proof (testimonials/case studies)
- Pricing with anchor value
- Guarantee (risk reversal)
- FAQ (objection handling)
- Final CTA

## Copywriting Style

- Conversational, confident, results-focused
- Use emotional momentum with storytelling
- Break up sections with short, rhythmic sentences
- Use ellipses and curiosity loops
- Inspired by Product Launch Formula methodology

## Examples

### Pre-Launch Content Drop 1 (Problem Agitation)

**Landing Page Headline:**
```
"Why 97% of [Target Audience] Fail to [Achieve Desired Outcome]
(And What the Top 3% Do Differently)"
```

**Email Teaser:**

Subject: The #1 reason [audience] struggle with [outcome]

```
Hey {first_name},

I've been thinking about something that's been bugging me...

Why do so many smart, capable [target audience] struggle to [achieve outcome]?

I've spent the last 6 months digging into this question.

I interviewed 47 people who [failed].
I interviewed 23 people who [succeeded].

And I found ONE critical difference.

It's not what you'd expect.

It's not about [common assumption #1].
It's not about [common assumption #2].
It's something much simpler... and much more fixable.

I put together a free training that explains exactly what I found.

You can watch it here: [LINK]

Fair warning: this might change how you think about [topic] forever.

Talk soon,
[Name]

P.S. - This is the first of 3 trainings I'm releasing this week. Each one builds on the last. By the end, you'll have a complete roadmap for [achieving outcome].
```

### Pre-Launch Content Drop 3 (Transformation Stories)

**Email:**

Subject: How Sarah went from [problem] to [result] in 90 days

```
{first_name},

Meet Sarah.

6 months ago, she was [specific problem/situation].

She'd tried [common solution #1]. Didn't work.
She'd tried [common solution #2]. Made things worse.
She was about to give up entirely.

Then she discovered [your method/approach].

90 days later?

[Specific result #1]
[Specific result #2]  
[Specific result #3]

Here's the crazy part: Sarah isn't special.

She's not smarter than you. She doesn't have more time. She didn't get lucky.

She just followed a proven system.

And tomorrow, I'm going to show you exactly what that system is.

For the first time ever, I'm opening enrollment to [Program Name].

This is the same program that helped Sarah (and 200+ others) [achieve transformation].

Enrollment opens tomorrow at 9am ET.

Mark your calendar. This is going to be big.

## Guidelines

**Avoid PLF Pitfalls:**
- Never: Start selling before building desire (content drops matter)
- Never: Open cart without established urgency mechanism
- Avoid: Weak content drops that don't deliver value
- Skip: Fake testimonials or inflated results

**Pre-Launch Best Practices:**
- Each content drop should deliver standalone value
- Build anticipation without revealing everything
- Use cliffhangers between drops
- Collect engagement data (opens, clicks, replies)
- Segment engaged leads for VIP treatment

**Content Drop Timing:**
- Drop 1: 7-10 days before launch (problem awareness)
- Drop 2: 4-6 days before launch (solution preview)
- Drop 3: 1-3 days before launch (transformation stories)
- Cart open: Day of launch
- Cart close: 4-7 days after open

**Launch Email Cadence:**
- Launch day: 1-2 emails
- Day 2-3: Daily emails (value, stories, proof)
- Day 4-5: Urgency emails (time running out)
- Final day: 2-3 emails (morning, afternoon, final)

**Cart Open/Close Psychology:**
- Real deadline creates real urgency
- Bonuses expiring works well
- "Doors close" language outperforms discounts
- Final-day emails drive 30-50% of sales

**Social Proof Timing:**
- Early: Testimonials from beta/past customers
- Mid-launch: Real-time enrollment numbers
- Late: "Join the 347 people who already enrolled"
- Close: Success stories + urgency combo

**Post-Launch Strategy:**
- Buyers: Onboarding sequence (deliver value fast)
- Non-buyers: Nurture sequence (don't burn bridge)
- Everyone: Collect feedback for next launch
- Plan: What will the next launch improve?

## Quality Checklist

- Do content drops build genuine anticipation?
- Does launch sequence create real urgency?
- Is offer stack compelling and valuable?
- Are emails strategically timed?
- Is cart open/close rhythm optimized?
- Does post-launch maximize revenue?
