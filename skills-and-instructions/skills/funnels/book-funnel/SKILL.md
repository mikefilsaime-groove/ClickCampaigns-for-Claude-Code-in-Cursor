If you're like most people, you probably flipped through, saw how much good stuff is in there, and then... life happened.

## Guidelines

**Avoid Book Funnel Pitfalls:**
- Never: Position the book as "free" then have hidden fees
- Never: Over-promise what the book delivers
- Avoid: Shipping costs over $9.95 (conversion killer)
- Skip: Generic "buy now" CTAs

**Free + Shipping Positioning:**
- Be transparent: "Just pay $7.95 shipping"
- Anchor the value: "This book sells for $19.95 on Amazon"
- Create urgency: "Limited print run" or "While supplies last"
- Address skepticism: "Why am I giving this away?"

**Book Value Communication:**
- Show the physical product (3D mockup works great)
- Include page count (bigger = more valuable)
- Chapter highlights > table of contents
- Reader results and testimonials

**Upsell Strategy:**
- Order bump: $7-$27, should be complementary
- OTO 1: $47-$197, natural next step
- Downsell: 50% of OTO price if declined
- Each upsell should stand alone as valuable

**Email Sequence Timing:**
- Order confirmation: Immediate
- Shipping notification: When shipped
- Delivery check-in: 3-5 days after expected delivery
- Value delivery: 7 days after delivery
- Backend offer: 14+ days after delivery

**Fulfillment Excellence:**
- Ship within 48 hours of order
- Include something unexpected (bookmark, note, bonus)
- Quality printing matters—cheap books hurt brand
- Have a replacement policy and honor it

## Quality Checklist

- Is the book positioned as genuinely valuable?
- Does the "free + shipping" offer feel compelling?
- Is the upsell stack valuable and relevant?
- Does the email sequence maximize conversions?
- Will readers feel the book delivered value?
- Does this bridge naturally to backend offers?
