## Guidelines

**Avoid Tripwire Pitfalls:**
- Never: Create fake scarcity (people can tell)
- Never: Over-deliver to the point of devaluing paid products
- Avoid: Complicated checkout flows
- Skip: Long sales pages for $7-$27 offers

**Pricing Psychology:**
- $7-$17: Impulse buy, minimal friction
- $27-$47: Still low-risk, higher perceived value
- $67-$97: Requires more social proof and copy
- Always anchor against higher "retail" value

**Irresistible Offer Formula:**
- Solve a specific, painful problem
- Deliver a quick win (usable in 24-72 hours)
- Stack tangible value (show $ amounts)
- Add urgency that's real and believable
- Make the price feel almost ridiculous

**Order Bump Optimization:**
- Position as a "no-brainer add-on"
- Keep under $27 for highest take rates
- Complement but don't duplicate main offer
- Use checkboxes, not separate buttons
- Expect 30-50% take rate with good copy

**OTO Strategy:**
- Price 3-10x the tripwire
- Give them the "how" if tripwire gave the "what"
- Include bonuses not available elsewhere
- Accept that 5-15% conversion is normal
- Always have a downsell if they decline

**Urgency That Converts:**
- Deadline funnels work (countdown per visitor)
- Limited bonuses expiring is believable
- "Cart closes at midnight" creates real action
- Never run fake deadlines—you'll lose trust

**Funnel Math:**
- Front-end should break even or small profit
- Order bump adds $5-$15 average per order
- OTO/downsell is where profit lives
- Track EPC (earnings per click) religiously

## Quality Checklist

- Is offer genuinely irresistible at this price?
- Does headline stop scroll and create desire?
- Is every funnel element optimized for conversion?
- Does upsell stack value perfectly?
- Will customers feel delighted after purchase?
- Does this bridge naturally to flagship offer?
