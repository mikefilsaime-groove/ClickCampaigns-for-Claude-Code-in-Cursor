# VSL Funnel Page Creation

Create high-converting Video Sales Letter (VSL) funnel pages that combine strategic video placement with supporting copy, social proof, and conversion elements for maximum sales.

## Primary Objective

Create VSL funnel pages that:
- Feature video as the primary conversion mechanism
- Support the video with strategic copy elements
- Include multiple conversion touchpoints
- Build credibility and overcome objections
- Drive fast action with urgency elements

## VSL Page Architecture

### Above-The-Fold Hero Section

**Video Player Placement:**
- Large, prominent video player (60-70% viewport width)
- Auto-play consideration based on platform
- Custom thumbnail with play button overlay
- Progress bar visible but not distracting

**Headline Above Video:**
- Curiosity-driven headline that creates desire to watch
- Subheadline that expands on transformation promise
- Keep short—video is the main attraction

**Example Headlines:**
- "Watch This Short Video to Discover [Transformation]"
- "The [Timeframe] Video That Could Change Everything"
- "Before You [Action], Watch This First"

### Below-Video Conversion Section

**Immediate CTA:**
- Clear, prominent button below video
- Benefit-driven text: "Get Instant Access" or "Start Your Transformation"
- High-contrast color (red, orange, or green)
- Arrow or urgency indicator

**Urgency Element (if real):**
- Countdown timer if deadline exists
- Limited spots indicator if genuine
- Price increase warning if scheduled

### Supporting Copy Section (Optional Hybrid)

**For skimmers who don't watch the video:**
- Key bullet points hitting main benefits
- "What You'll Discover" section
- Brief transformation statement

**Keep minimal—don't compete with video:**
- 5-7 bullet points maximum
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Use curiosity to drive video views

### Social Proof Section

**Testimonial Integration:**
- Video testimonials are most powerful (thumbnail with play)
- Photo + quote testimonials with specific results
- Star ratings or aggregate proof
- "As Seen In" media logos if applicable

**Placement:**
- After first CTA for those who need more proof
- Before final CTA to reinforce decision

### Value Stack Section

**Visual Value Presentation:**
- Each component with associated value
- Crossed-out "retail" price
- Special offer price prominently displayed
- Total value vs. investment contrast

**Stack Elements:**
- Core offer
- Bonuses (2-3 maximum)
- Guarantee value
- Total package value

### Guarantee Section

**Risk Reversal:**
- Clear guarantee badge/seal
- Specific terms (30/60/90 days)
- What they can expect
- Easy refund process

**Trust Elements:**
- Secure checkout badges
- Money-back promise language
- "Nothing to lose" framing

### FAQ Section

**Objection Handling:**
- 5-7 common questions
- Price objection
- Time/effort concern
- "Will this work for me?"
- Technical/access questions
- Guarantee/refund process

### Final CTA Section

**Strong Close:**
- Recap key transformation
- Final urgency reminder
- Large, unmissable button
- Reminder of guarantee

## Design Guidelines

### Color Philosophy

**Direct Response Colors (Default):**
- Background: White (#FFFFFF) or light gray (#F7FAFC)
- Headlines: Dark (#1A202C, #2D3748)
- Body text: Medium gray (#4A5568)
- CTA Buttons: RED (#E53E3E), ORANGE (#ED8936), or GREEN (#38A169)
- Highlights: Yellow (#ECC94B)

**When to use brand colors:**
- Only if explicitly requested
- Balanced approach: Brand accent colors on non-CTA elements
- Never brand-color the CTA button unless specifically asked

### Layout Principles

- Single column for focus
- Video is hero element
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Generous white space
- Mobile-responsive design

### Typography

- Large, readable headlines
- Scannable bullet points
- Clear visual separation between sections
- Bold for emphasis on key points

## HTML Output Requirements

When generating VSL pages, include:
- Complete HTML document structure
- Responsive CSS (mobile-first)
- Video embed placeholder: `[VIDEO EMBED HERE]`
- Form placeholder: `[CHECKOUT FORM HERE]`
- Image placeholders: `[TESTIMONIAL IMAGE]`, `[PRODUCT IMAGE]`

## Quality Checklist

- Is the video player prominent and compelling?
- Does the headline create desire to watch?
- Are CTAs visible and benefit-driven?
- Does social proof feel authentic?
- Is the value stack clear and compelling?
- Does the guarantee reduce risk?
- Are objections preemptively handled?
- Is the page mobile-responsive?
