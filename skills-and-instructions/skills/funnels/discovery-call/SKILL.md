## Guidelines

**Avoid Booking Page Pitfalls:**
- Never: Make them guess what the call is about
- Never: Use "Book a Call" as your only CTA (too vague)
- Avoid: Requiring too much info upfront (max 3-4 fields)
- Skip: Generic testimonials that don't mention results

**Headline Formulas:**
- "Discover How to [Specific Outcome] Without [Common Pain]"
- "Get Your Free [Type] Strategy Session"
- "[Outcome] in [Timeframe]—Let's Map Your Path"
- Bad: "Schedule a Call" / Good: "Get Your Personalized Growth Plan"

**Value Stack Rules:**
- List 3-5 specific things they GET from the call
- Use checkmarks or bullet points
- Each item should be a tangible deliverable
- End with something like "...and more"

**Urgency That Works:**
- Real scarcity: "Only 5 spots available this week"
- Social proof urgency: "Last week, all spots filled in 24 hours"
- Don't fake it: If you're not limited, don't say you are
- Countdown timers work IF the deadline is real

**Pre-Call Sequence Best Practices:**
- Confirmation email within 5 minutes of booking
- Reminder at 24 hours AND 2 hours before
- Include Zoom link in EVERY email
- Make rescheduling easy (reduces no-shows)

**No-Show Reduction Tactics:**
- SMS reminder option (increases show rates by 20-30%)
- Pre-call questionnaire creates commitment
- Send value in advance (they don't want to miss getting more)
- Personal touch: "I'm looking forward to YOUR call specifically"

**Form Field Optimization:**
- Essential: Name, Email, Phone
- Optional: One qualifying question
- Don't ask: Address, company size, budget (too early)
- Every added field reduces conversions by ~10%

**Mobile Considerations:**
- Booking widget must work flawlessly on mobile
- Click-to-call phone number
- Calendar should auto-detect timezone
- Test on iPhone AND Android

## Quality Checklist

- Does the headline clearly communicate booking value?
- Is the booking process frictionless and mobile-friendly?
- Does the pre-call sequence build anticipation?
- Is the value proposition specific and compelling?
- Does this position the consultant as the obvious choice?
- Are objections preemptively addressed?
- Is urgency real and believable?
