# Live Webinar Funnel

Build high-converting webinar registration pages and follow-up sequences using the most successful webinar marketing principles from **Mike Filsaime (Webinar Control)**, **Andy Jenkins (Webinar Genesis)**, **Russell Brunson (Perfect Webinar)**, and **Jason Fladlien (One-To-Many)**.

## Core Objectives

- Maximize registrations AND show-up rate
- Build anticipation for the transformation delivered on the webinar
- Clearly articulate the *reason to register now*
- Position the host as an authority and mentor
- Create momentum to attend live (or on replay)

## Registration Page Structure

### 1. Above-the-Fold Section

**Headline:** Focus on transformation, problem solved, or secret revealed
- "How to [Achieve Outcome] Without [Pain Point]"
- "The [Number] Secrets to [Desired Result] Revealed"
- "Discover the [Counterintuitive Method] That [Creates Transformation]"

**Subheadline:** Preview the promise or core benefit of attending

**Date/Time Widget:** Include time zone converter and calendar reminder option

**Primary CTA Button:** e.g., "Reserve My Spot Now" or "Join the Free Training"

[Place Hero Image or Presenter Headshot/Thumbnail Here]

### 2. What You'll Learn / 3 Secrets Section

Break down 3-5 value-driven promises or secrets revealed in the webinar.

**Apply Jason Fladlien's Method:** ONE webinar, ONE core idea, MULTIPLE hooks

**Structure each bullet as Feature → Outcome:**
- "Secret #1: The [Method Name] that [Specific Result] (even if you've tried everything else)"
- "Secret #2: Why [Common Belief] is actually keeping you stuck—and what to do instead"
- "Secret #3: The exact [Framework/System] I used to [Specific Transformation] in [Timeframe]"

### 3. Meet Your Host Section

Highlight the authority, experience, or backstory of the presenter using transformation-based storytelling (from struggle → discovery → success).

[Insert Presenter Image or Media Mentions]

### 4. Why This Webinar Is Different

**Apply Andy Jenkins' "Contrarian Hook" Structure:**
- Dismantle myths or assumptions the audience already believes
- Use tension, bold claims, or polarizing truths
- Example: "Everything you've been told about [topic] is wrong. On this webinar, I'll prove it."

### 5. Social Proof / Testimonials

- Video or quote-based testimonials from past webinar attendees or clients
- Emphasize transformation or "aha moment" epiphanies
- Use specific results: "I implemented what Mike taught and added $12,000 in revenue that month"

### 6. Urgency & Scarcity Layer

- Countdown timer to next webinar slot (live or simulated)
- Text cues: "Seats are limited – secure yours now"
- Apply Filsaime's webinar stacking logic if offering multiple times/dates

### 7. Call-to-Action (Sticky or Repeating)

- Clear CTA repeated every scroll/section
- CTA copy examples: "Yes, Save My Seat" / "Unlock My Spot Now"
- Keep form simple: first name + email only
- [Place Trust Badge or Secure Registration Icon]

## Guidelines

**Avoid Webinar Page Pitfalls:**
- Never: Use vague headlines like "Join My Free Webinar"
- Never: Hide the date/time below the fold
- Avoid: Walls of text without visual breaks
- Skip: Multiple CTAs competing for attention

**Registration Page Best Practices:**
- Video thumbnail with play button overlay boosts engagement
- Countdown timer must be visible above-the-fold
- Use vibrant color contrast on CTA buttons
- Mobile-first layout with thumb-friendly spacing
- Keep form to 2 fields max (name + email)

**Copywriting Style (Per Mike Filsaime):**
- Conversational, benefit-rich, urgency-aware
- Use open loops and ellipses (...) to build anticipation
- Combine Fladlien's logical close with emotional storytelling
- Break up text every 2-4 lines for scannability

**Show-Up Rate Optimization:**
- SMS reminders increase attendance 20-30%
- Calendar integration is mandatory
- "What you'll miss" language in reminders
- Live-only bonuses create FOMO
- Personal message from host builds connection

**The Perfect Webinar Structure (Russell Brunson):**
- Origin story → builds credibility
- 3 Secrets → destroys false beliefs
- Stack → builds overwhelming value
- Close → makes decision easy

## Quality Checklist

- Does the registration page create genuine excitement?
- Is the value proposition crystal clear in 5 seconds?
- Does the 3 Secrets section use the Fladlien method?
- Does the reminder sequence maximize live attendance?
- Is the post-webinar follow-up properly segmented?
- Does urgency feel real and compelling?
