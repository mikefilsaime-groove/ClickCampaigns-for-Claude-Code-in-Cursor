## Guidelines

**Avoid Quiz Pitfalls:**
- Never: Ask for email before delivering value
- Never: Create generic results that apply to everyone
- Avoid: More than 12 questions (completion drops)
- Skip: Complex branching that confuses users

**Question Design Rules:**
- Start with easy, engaging questions
- One question per screen (mobile-friendly)
- Progress bar is mandatory (reduces abandonment)
- Every question must serve segmentation purpose
- Mix diagnostic (what they do) with psychographic (why they do it)

**Results Page Requirements:**
- Feel personalized (use their quiz answers)
- Provide genuine insight (not just flattery)
- Include specific action steps
- Bridge naturally to relevant offer
- Don't make the CTA the only value

**Segmentation Best Practices:**
- 3-5 outcome categories is ideal
- Each outcome needs its own email sequence
- Tag extensively for future personalization
- Track which outcomes convert best

**Conversion Optimization:**
- Show social proof: "47,000+ people have taken this"
- Promise quick completion: "Under 2 minutes"
- Guarantee value: "Get your personalized report"
- Reduce friction: Email only, not name required

**Technical Considerations:**
- Mobile-first design (60%+ will be mobile)
- Save progress (in case they abandon)
- Integrate with CRM via proper field mapping
- Retargeting pixels for incomplete quizzes

## Quality Checklist

- Does the quiz hook create genuine curiosity?
- Are questions strategically designed for segmentation?
- Do results feel truly personalized?
- Is the action plan specific and valuable?
- Does the offer bridge naturally from results?
- Is completion time under 3 minutes?
- Are email sequences tailored per outcome?
