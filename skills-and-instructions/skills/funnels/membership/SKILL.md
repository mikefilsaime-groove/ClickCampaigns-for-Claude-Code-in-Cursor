## Guidelines

**Avoid Membership Pitfalls:**
- Never: Launch without 2-3 months of content ready
- Never: Overpromise on value delivery cadence
- Avoid: Making members feel overwhelmed with content
- Skip: Community without active moderation

**Pricing Strategy:**
- Monthly: Higher per-month, lower commitment ($47-$197)
- Annual: 30-40% discount vs monthly (encourages commitment)
- Lifetime: 2-3x annual price (for superfans)
- Always default to annual in pricing display

**Value Delivery Cadence:**
- Content should be "just right"—not overwhelming
- Weekly is usually better than daily
- Monthly themes help create structure
- New content keeps members engaged
- Don't bury old content—resurface it

**Onboarding Best Practices:**
- First 7 days determine retention
- Guide them to ONE quick win immediately
- Community introduction is critical
- Celebrate their first engagement
- Don't dump everything at once

**Retention Levers:**
- Community engagement = highest retention
- Progress tracking keeps people invested
- Member recognition creates belonging
- Exclusive events create FOMO to stay
- Monthly recaps remind them of value

**Churn Reduction:**
- Check on inactive members (30+ days no login)
- Send "we miss you" emails
- Offer pause option instead of cancel
- Exit survey to understand why
- Win-back sequence after cancellation

**Community Management:**
- Moderator response time matters
- Highlight member wins publicly
- Create engagement rituals (weekly threads)
- Prevent negativity from spreading
- Make members feel seen and valued

## Quality Checklist

- Does membership provide genuine ongoing value?
- Is sales page conversion-optimized?
- Does onboarding deliver immediate value?
- Is retention strategy strong?
- Will members feel value continuously?
