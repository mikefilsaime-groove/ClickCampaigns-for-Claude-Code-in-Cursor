4. **The Big Promise** - Tease transformation with "New, Easy, Safe, Big" messaging
5. **Micro-Tease the Offer** - Hint at solution, keep watching
6. **Agitate with Story** - Emotional BEFORE state narrative
7. **Reveal the Solution** - Name product, unveil benefits
8. **Stack the Value** - Anchor value vs. price, introduce bonuses
9. **Social Proof** - Testimonials with micro-narratives
10. **Call to Action #1** - Direct ask with emotional hook
11. **Handle Objections** - Voice and knock down objections
12. **Call to Action #2** - Stronger with urgency
13. **Future Pacing** - Help visualize transformation
14. **Final CTA + Soft Close** - Warm, confident close

## VSL Script Writing Guidelines

- Include [VSL Slide Change] or [On Screen: TEXT] cues
- Every sentence must earn the next second
- Emulate John Benson tone with Caleb O'Dowd layered persuasion

## Examples

### VSL Script Opening (Parts 1-3)

```
[VSL Slide Change: Black screen, white text]

[On Screen: "WARNING: What you're about to see may change everything you think you know about [topic]."]

[VOICEOVER - Pattern Interrupt]

Stop.

Before you click away... before you scroll to the next video...

I need to ask you one question.

What if everything you've been told about [problem] is completely... wrong?

I know that sounds crazy. I know that sounds like hype.

But in the next 7 minutes, I'm going to show you something that made me question everything.

[VSL Slide Change: Photo of frustrated person]

[VOICEOVER - Amplify the Pain]

Let me guess...

You're tired.

Tired of trying every new [solution] that promises results... only to end up right back where you started.

Tired of watching other people succeed while you feel stuck.

Tired of that voice in your head that says, "Maybe this just isn't for me."

I get it. I was there.

[VSL Slide Change: Personal photo - before]

[VOICEOVER - Credibility Without Bragging]

My name is [Name], and honestly... I wasn't supposed to be the person telling you this.

Three years ago, I was [specific struggle].

I had tried [common solutions]. Spent [money amount] on [courses/tools].

Nothing worked.

Until...

## Guidelines

**Avoid VSL Clichés:**
- Never: "Are you tired of [obvious problem]?" (overused opening)
- Never: "What if I told you..." (instantly recognizable)
- Avoid: Fake scarcity that viewers can see through
- Skip: Excessive income claims without proper disclaimers

**Hook Requirements:**
- First 15 seconds must stop the scroll AND keep watching
- Use pattern interrupt: say something unexpected
- Create curiosity gap: make them need to know the answer
- Don't reveal too much too fast

**Script Tone:**
- Write for the EAR, not the eye
- Short sentences. Punchy.
- Natural pauses (...) create tension
- Read it out loud—does it sound like a real person?

**Pacing Rules:**
- New idea or story beat every 30-60 seconds
- Never go more than 2 minutes without emotional shift
- Build tension → release → build → release
- Save biggest reveal for middle (not beginning)

**CTA Placement:**
- First CTA: After value stack reveal (around 60-70% through)
- Second CTA: After handling objections
- Final CTA: Warm, assumptive close at end
- Each CTA slightly different angle/wording

**Social Proof Guidelines:**
- Video testimonials > written testimonials
- Specific results > vague praise
- "Before I found this, I was..." format works best
- 3-5 testimonials is ideal (more feels manufactured)

**Design Rules:**
- Video is the HERO—everything else supports it
- Don't distract from the video with animations
- Keep page simple until video makes the pitch
- Mobile: video should be nearly full-width

**Length Guidelines:**
- Short VSL (lead gen): 8-15 minutes
- Medium VSL (low-ticket): 15-30 minutes
- Long VSL (high-ticket): 30-60 minutes
- Rule: longer = higher price point

## Quality Checklist

- Does the headline create irresistible desire to watch?
- Does the VSL follow the 14-part framework?
- Are CTAs visible and benefit-driven?
- Does social proof feel authentic?
- Is the value stack compelling?
- Are objections preemptively handled?
- Is the page mobile-responsive?
