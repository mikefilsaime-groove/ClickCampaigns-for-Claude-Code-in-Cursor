### Day 5 Email (Pitch Day)

Subject: Final day + your next step (important)

```
{first_name},

WOW.

We made it to Day 5.

Look at what you've accomplished:

✅ Day 1: You found your profitable topic
✅ Day 2: You created your outline
✅ Day 3: You built your slides
✅ Day 4: You set up your tech
✅ Day 5: You're ready to launch

In just 5 days, you went from "I've never done a webinar" to "I have everything I need to go live."

That's incredible.

But here's the truth...

Building the webinar is only half the battle.

The other half? Actually SELLING on your webinar.

Most people get stuck here. They have a great webinar but don't know how to close. Or they feel "salesy" and apologize for their offer. Or they leave thousands of dollars on the table because they don't understand webinar psychology.

That's exactly why I created **[Program Name]**.

It's the complete system for turning your webinar into a revenue-generating machine.

Inside, you'll learn:
→ The exact script that's generated $10M+ in webinar sales
→ How to make offers that feel natural, not pushy
→ The follow-up sequence that doubles your conversions
→ Advanced tactics for scaling your webinar

**For challenge participants only:**
Join in the next 48 hours and get:

🎁 BONUS #1: [Bonus Name] ($XXX value)
🎁 BONUS #2: [Bonus Name] ($XXX value)
🎁 BONUS #3: [Bonus Name] ($XXX value)

These bonuses expire at midnight on [Date].

[CLICK HERE TO JOIN [PROGRAM NAME]]

You've already done the hard part. Let me show you how to make it pay off.

See you inside?

- [Name]

P.S. - I'll be doing a special Q&A session for challenge members at [TIME] today. Bring your questions about the program, webinar selling, or anything else. [ZOOM LINK]

## Guidelines

**Avoid Challenge Pitfalls:**
- Never: Run a challenge without clear daily outcomes
- Never: Make Day 5 ALL pitch (deliver value first)
- Avoid: Technical difficulties during live sessions
- Skip: Passive challenges where no one engages

**Challenge Structure Best Practices:**
- 5 days is ideal (7 max, 3 minimum)
- Daily time commitment: 30-60 minutes
- One clear deliverable per day
- Live sessions create urgency and FOMO
- Community is where magic happens

**Registration Page Optimization:**
- Promise a specific tangible outcome
- Show the daily breakdown (people love schedules)
- Use countdown to start date

**Engagement Maximizers:**
- Daily email reminders with clear CTAs
- Community prompts that encourage sharing
- Recognize and celebrate participants publicly
- Create friendly competition (leaderboards optional)
- Respond to comments—every single one

**Pitch Day Strategy:**
- Day 5 should be 70% value, 30% pitch
- Pitch AFTER delivering the final transformation
- Challenge-only bonuses create urgency
- Give them 48-72 hours to decide
- Follow up on Days 6-7 for non-buyers

**Live Session Best Practices:**
- Start on time (respect their commitment)

- Engage with chat during sessions
- End with clear homework and next step
