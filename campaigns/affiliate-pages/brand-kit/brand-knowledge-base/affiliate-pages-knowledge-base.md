## Tell Your Story. What life was like before you cracked the code. The pain points of that life.

My name is Mike Filsaime. Before I figured out affiliate marketing, I was living paycheck to paycheck. I was in the car business as a person working in the sales department. I worked my way up to General Sales Manager of some of the largest car dealerships in the United States, but I found myself working close to 65 hours a week, 26 days a month. I was living paycheck to paycheck and was always in debt.

## How does your company solve these challenges or pain points?

Our company solves this by allowing users to find hot-selling affiliate products With our training program. What we provide is a software that allows them to input the website that they want to review as well as the URL of other people's reviews and the URL of other people's YouTube reviews. We then create a knowledge base with all of that information and feed it to AI, and then AI will create a review site for them or any of the sections of the review site.

We then allow them to put their affiliate link for any product it can create a single off review for instance for a product like GoHighLevel, or it could create a vs review (multiple vs like GoHighLevel vs ClickFunnels vs Kajabi) or simply GoHighLevel vs ClickFunnels. And they would add their affiliate link to every one of those products. Then they would say if they want the review to be poor, fair, good, or excellent, and the AI will write the reviews. The AI writes the reviews specialized for SEO with keyword density. The entire page is written in respect for SEO and then it is pasted into WordPress which the search engines love for SEO. This makes it very easy for the user to create three different review products per day. It takes all of the work out of it for them.
