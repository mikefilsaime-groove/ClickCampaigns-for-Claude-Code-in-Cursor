# Campaigns Folder

Each campaign gets its own folder with this structure:

```
campaigns/
└── [campaign-name]/
    ├── brand-kit/
    │   ├── brand-knowledge-base/
    │   └── brand-style-guide/
    └── output-assets/
        ├── html/
        ├── documents/
        ├── emails/
        ├── ads/
        ├── presentations/
        ├── pdfs/
        └── images/
```

Tell Claude: "Create a campaign called '[your-campaign-name]'"
