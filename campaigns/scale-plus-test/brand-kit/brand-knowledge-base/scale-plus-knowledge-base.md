# Scale Plus Brand Knowledge Base

## Brand Story

### Before (The Pain)
In the past, creating software was our passion, but it was costly. A good quality developer costs between $8,000 and $15,000 per month, so that just wasn't feasible for us.

What we went with was outsourcing developers in the Philippines or India or Eastern Europe for about 75% off what it would cost for a US developer. But you are also getting 75% less quality. The trade-off wasn't worth it, and so our vision to create quality software fast ended up being poor quality software very slow.

### The Inciting Event
AI coding came around, and with my background in programming in the past and my partner Matt Zeralta's background, we have the ability to use AI coding ourselves and prototype applications very fast. We can do in sometimes hours what would take months and sometimes days what would take a year. And we are now able to create quality software on top of that. Our entire development team is now small, with our other actual programmers now adopting AI development. We are writing quality code, beautiful applications that's allowing us to rethink how we can do software.

### Life Today
Today, we are creating applications at the speed of thought. AI coding has allowed us to create applications in hours that would normally take months or days that would normally take years. Our developers are now using AI to refactor code, create bugs, enhance the UI, and make our existing and past software greater and creating new software that our members need much faster.

## Business Motivation

We have decided to create Scale.gg+ because we felt that the Groove platform was good but we wanted to add even more products into the suite. We were very good for digital marketers that were able to create funnels where they didn't have to meet with their customers and they call their buyers customers. These people would do what I call self-checkout: they go through their funnels, they enter their email address, they go through an ascension funnel, and they check out at a web page and they get instant fulfillment.

Where we were very weak was in what I call the client services business - things for agencies, coaches, consultants, professionals like accountants and lawyers etc. where you don't have a customer go through self-check out. They easily book an appointment and they set up a phone call to talk with you or a sales rep on a phone call or Zoom. Then you create a custom price and package for them and then you need proper invoicing software to track down the invoicing and you need an actual CRM that doesn't do one-too-many broadcast emails (it sends an email through a CRM that works with your actual email address). You meet with the client on a phone call or a Zoom call and you don't call them customers, you call them clients. You deal with face-to-face and usually higher ticket pricing in the thousands of dollars. You're not looking for hundreds of thousands of customers, you're looking for 20 to 25 clients. We realized we needed to not only cater to digital marketers (which is what we did with Groove.cm) but also expand our suite to work with agencies and professionals that in turn themselves have clients and create better CRM, regeneration, and invoicing software and AI tools to help them.

## Primary Brand Goal

The primary goal we have for our brand is to have an affordable solution of just $497/year or $99/month. That's the choice the customer gets to have everything they need in their business on an all-in-one platform. Where they no longer need applications like Go High Level or Kartra or ClickFunnels or SamCart or Kajabi or Skool. This would be the one-stop place for everyone. And we also want to make our price so affordable that there's no reason anyone could come to compete with us and no reason our users would ever leave us. We want them to have a one-stop place where everything they need to run their business is there.

## Passion & Purpose

What drives my passion is I like helping people. I know that money is a byproduct of providing value. I love software, I love creating software that automates processes and I love sharing it with digital marketers and coaches, consultants, and professionals that have clients.

---

## Credibility & Trust

I have created software used by millions of people from Groove.cm, Groove.ai, Kartra, WebinarJam, EverWebinar, and Courses.gg. I have been in this industry now for over 20 years. I am asked to be the keynote speaker on stage and part of many masterminds because we have over a hundred thousand customers over the years my reputation online as a digital marketing expert is second to none.
