## Part 1: Pattern Interrupt & Hook (0:00-0:45)

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Black screen]

[ON SCREEN: "Warning: This video contains math that might make you angry."]

[PAUSE - 3 seconds]

How much are you paying for software every month?

No really... think about it.

Add it up.

Your funnel builder. Your email platform. Your course hosting. Your CRM. Your calendar. Your checkout system. Your webinar tool.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

If you're like most online business owners I talk to...

That number is somewhere between **eight hundred and fifteen hundred dollars a month.**

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Calculator showing $1,200/month]

[ON SCREEN: "$1,200/month = $14,400/year"]

That's over **fourteen thousand dollars a year**...

...just to run software that doesn't even work together properly.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

What if I told you there's a way to cut that number by **90 percent**?

And actually have tools that talk to each other... that work together... that were BUILT to work together?

That's exactly what I'm going to show you in the next few minutes.

And if you stick with me until the end...

I'm going to make you an offer that might genuinely change how you run your business in 2026.

## Part 2: Empathetic Mirroring - The Pain (0:45-3:00)

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Frustrated entrepreneur at computer]

Let me paint a picture.

It's Tuesday morning. You've got a launch happening this week.

You need to check your email stats... so you log into your email platform.

Then you need to see how your landing page is converting... so you log into your funnel builder.

Oh wait, someone booked a call... that's in your calendar tool.

And you've got to check if that payment went through... that's your checkout system.

And hold on—your CRM says a lead came in, but it's not showing up in your email list...

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Spider web of logos - ClickFunnels, Kajabi, ActiveCampaign, etc.]

[ON SCREEN: "The Duct-Tape Tech Stack"]

Sound familiar?

You're jumping between tabs. You're logging into six different dashboards. You're praying the Zapier connection didn't break overnight.

And instead of actually GROWING your business...

You're playing tech support.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Here's what nobody tells you:

**This isn't normal.**

This isn't just "the cost of doing business online."

This is a system that's been designed to extract maximum revenue from you...

...by keeping you fragmented.

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Money flying away]

Think about it.

ClickFunnels wants you to pay them $147 a month.

Kajabi wants their $149.

ActiveCampaign wants their $49.

GoHighLevel wants their $297.

Each company only cares about their piece of the puzzle.

**None of them are incentivized to give you everything in one place.**

Because that would mean... you'd stop paying all of them.

And so you're stuck.

Stuck paying thousands of dollars a year for tools that barely work together.

Stuck troubleshooting integrations that break every time someone pushes an update.

Stuck feeling like a tech person when you signed up to be an entrepreneur.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

But here's the thing...

**It's not your fault.**

You did what everyone told you to do.

You bought the tools the gurus recommended.

You set up the tech stack the courses told you to set up.

The system was designed this way. You just got caught in it.

And until now... there wasn't really an alternative.

## Part 3: Credibility & The Discovery (3:00-6:00)

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Photo of Mike Filsaime]

My name is Mike Filsaime.

And I've spent the last 20-plus years building software for entrepreneurs like you.

[ON SCREEN: Logos - Groove.cm, Kartra, WebinarJam, EverWebinar]

You might know some of the platforms I've created:

Groove.cm. Groove.ai. Kartra. WebinarJam. EverWebinar. Courses.gg.

Combined, these tools have been used by **millions of people** to build their businesses online.

I've spoken on stages around the world. I've been part of masterminds with the biggest names in digital marketing.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

But here's what most people don't know:

I've ALSO been on the other side.

I've been the entrepreneur cobbling together tools.

I've been the guy losing sleep because an integration broke right before a launch.

I know what it's like to watch money drain out of your account every month... paying for ten different subscriptions... wondering if there's a better way.

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Lightbulb moment]

And about two years ago, my team and I made a decision.

We were going to build something different.

Not another "piece" of the puzzle.

The **whole** puzzle.

A platform that would give entrepreneurs EVERYTHING they need to run their business...

In one place.

With one login.

For one price that actually makes sense.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

See, here's what we realized:

The reason nobody had done this before... is because it's HARD.

It's easier to build one tool and charge a subscription for it.

It's easier to let someone else worry about the other pieces.

But we had something most companies don't have:

Twenty years of experience building these tools.

A team that had already created funnels, email, webinars, checkout systems, courses, CRMs...

We'd built all the pieces before. Separately.

Now it was time to bring them together.

## Part 4: The Big Promise (6:00-8:00)

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Scale Plus logo reveal]

[ON SCREEN: "Introducing Scale Plus"]

Introducing **Scale Plus.**

The only true all-in-one platform for online business owners.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Scale Plus isn't just "another software tool."

It's the platform that lets you:

[ON SCREEN: Bullet points appearing one by one]

**Build funnels and websites** without paying ClickFunnels.

**Send emails and automations** without paying ActiveCampaign.

**Host courses and memberships** without paying Kajabi.

**Run webinars on autopilot** without paying EverWebinar separately.

**Manage your CRM and pipeline** without paying GoHighLevel.

**Process payments** without paying SamCart.

**Book appointments** without paying Calendly.

**Build a community** without paying Skool.

**Use AI to create campaigns** without paying for five different AI tools.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: 25+ app logos in a grid]

[ON SCREEN: "25+ Applications. One Platform."]

All of this. In one place. Working together seamlessly.

Because it was all **built** to work together.

Not integrated after the fact.

Not connected through Zapier.

Built. Together. From the ground up.

That's the difference.

And that difference changes everything.

## Part 6: The Math & Value Stack (13:00-16:00)

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Calculator graphic]

[ON SCREEN: "Let's Do The Math"]

Now let's talk about what this would cost you if you bought everything separately.

[ON SCREEN: Table building line by line]

ClickFunnels... $147 per month.

Kajabi... $149 per month.

GoHighLevel... $297 per month.

ActiveCampaign... $49 per month.

SamCart... $99 per month.

EverWebinar... $42 per month when you break down the annual.

Calendly Pro... $12 per month.

Skool... $99 per month.

AI tools... let's say conservatively $100 per month.

[ON SCREEN: Total: $1,094/month]

**That's over a thousand dollars a month.**

**Over twelve thousand dollars a year.**

And that's a CONSERVATIVE estimate.

Some of you are paying even more.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Price comparison]

With Scale Plus, you get ALL of this—and more—for **$149 per month.**

That's already an incredible deal.

You're saving over ten thousand dollars a year JUST by switching.

But today... I'm not going to charge you $149 a month.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Special offer reveal]

[ON SCREEN: "2026 Fresh Start Offer"]

Because you're watching this video right now... at the start of 2026...

I want to help you start the year RIGHT.

So here's what I'm offering:

[ON SCREEN: "$497 for your ENTIRE first year"]

**Scale Plus for just $497 for your entire first year.**

That's 70 percent off.

That's just $41 and change per month.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Let me say that again so it sinks in.

Twenty-five plus applications.

Everything you need to run your online business.

AI tools that create campaigns for you.

CRM. Email. Funnels. Courses. Webinars. Checkout. Calendar. Invoicing.

**All of it for $497 for the year.**

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Savings calculation]

[ON SCREEN: "You save $1,291 in year one"]

Compared to the regular $149 per month price... you're saving **$1,291** in your first year alone.

Compared to what you're probably paying now for separate tools?

You could be saving **ten thousand dollars or more.**

After your first year, you continue at $149 per month—still a fraction of what separate tools cost.

But that first-year savings? It's yours to keep.

## Part 7: Social Proof & Testimonials (16:00-18:00)

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Testimonial section]

[ON SCREEN: "What Members Are Saying"]

Now, I know what you might be thinking.

"This sounds great, Mike... but does it actually work?"

Let me share what some of our members have experienced.

[SHOW TESTIMONIAL]

[ON SCREEN: Photo of Marc]

Marc was using five different platforms. Paying over $600 a month. Spending hours every week just managing his tech.

After switching to Scale Plus, he consolidated everything into one dashboard. Cut his software costs by 80 percent. And more importantly... he got his TIME back.

[SHOW TESTIMONIAL]

[ON SCREEN: Photo of Robyn]

Robyn runs a coaching business. She was drowning in admin work—sending follow-ups, tracking clients, managing payments.

With Scale Plus, she automated her client onboarding, set up recurring invoicing, and built a funnel that generates leads while she sleeps.

Her words: "I finally feel like I'm running my business instead of my business running me."

[SHOW TESTIMONIAL]

[ON SCREEN: Photo of Tom]

Tom is an agency owner. He was skeptical because he'd been burned by "all-in-one" platforms before.

But he gave Scale Plus a shot. Within two weeks, he'd migrated his entire operation. His team uses the CRM, the email, the invoicing—everything.

He told me: "This is the first platform that actually delivers on the all-in-one promise."

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

These aren't special cases.

These are regular entrepreneurs who got tired of the duct-tape tech stack.

And decided to try something different.

## Part 8: Objection Handling (18:00-20:00)

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: FAQ section]

[ON SCREEN: "You Might Be Wondering..."]

Now, let me address some questions you might have.

**"Is this going to be complicated to set up?"**

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Simple dashboard]

Scale Plus was designed for non-technical entrepreneurs. Drag and drop. Templates. Step-by-step tutorials.

If you can use ClickFunnels or Kajabi, you can use Scale Plus. Most people have their first funnel up within a day.

**"What if I already have content in other platforms?"**

We've built migration tools and have a support team that can help you move your pages, your contacts, your courses over.

You don't have to lose what you've built.

**"What if it doesn't work for my specific situation?"**

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Guarantee badge]

[ON SCREEN: "30-Day Money-Back Guarantee"]

That's why we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Try Scale Plus for a full month. Explore everything. Build your funnels. Set up your email. Test the AI tools.

If you're not completely satisfied—for any reason—just email our support team.

We'll refund your $497. No questions asked. No hoops to jump through.

**You literally cannot lose.**

Either you get an incredible platform that transforms your business...

Or you get your money back.

**"Why is the price so low? What's the catch?"**

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

No catch.

Here's our philosophy: We'd rather have a hundred thousand happy customers paying us a fair price...

Than ten thousand frustrated customers paying us too much.

We make money when you succeed and stay with us for years.

That only happens if we deliver massive value.

So that's what we focus on.

## Part 9: Future Pacing (20:00-21:30)

[VSL SLIDE CHANGE: Vision of the future]

[ON SCREEN: "Imagine..."]

Let me ask you to imagine something.

It's January 2027.

You look back on 2026... and something's different.

You're not stressed about software. You haven't troubleshot an integration in months.

You log into ONE dashboard every morning. Everything you need is there.

Your funnels are converting. Your emails are sending. Your clients are booking calls automatically.

You've saved thousands of dollars in subscriptions.

And that money? It's in YOUR account. Not spread across ten different software companies.

[PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Your business feels... lighter.

You have time to actually work ON your business instead of IN it.

You have margin. Breathing room. Freedom.

That's what happens when you have the right tools.

That's what Scale Plus makes possible.
