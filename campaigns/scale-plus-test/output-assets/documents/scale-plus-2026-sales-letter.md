Dear Fellow Entrepreneur,

If you've ever looked at your monthly software subscriptions and felt a knot form in your stomach...

If you've spent hours trying to get one tool to "talk" to another tool—only to watch everything break when one of them updates...

If you're exhausted from logging into 7 different dashboards just to run what should be a simple online business...

Then the next few minutes could change your entire 2026.

Here's why:

I'm about to show you how to eliminate the chaos, cancel the subscriptions, and run your entire business from ONE platform—with tools that actually work together because they were built to work together.

And I'm going to make you an offer so good, you'd be crazy not to take it.

But first, let me tell you how we got here...

---

## The Problem Nobody Talks About (But Everyone Experiences)

You know the feeling.

You start an online business with big dreams. You're going to build courses. Sell coaching. Run an agency. Finally have that freedom you've been chasing.

So you do what everyone tells you to do:

You sign up for ClickFunnels to build funnels. **$147/month.**

You need email automation, so you add ActiveCampaign. **$49/month.**

Then you realize you need a course platform. Kajabi looks good. **$149/month.**

Oh wait, you need a CRM to manage your leads. GoHighLevel, everyone says. **$297/month.**

Don't forget scheduling software. Calendly Pro. **$12/month.**

A checkout system with order bumps? SamCart. **$99/month.**

Webinar software? EverWebinar. **$499/year.**

A community platform? Skool. **$99/month.**

Before you know it, you're spending **$800-$1,500+ per month** just on software.

And the worst part?

**None of it works together properly.**

You're constantly:
- ✗ Copying and pasting data between platforms
- ✗ Setting up Zapier connections that break every other week
- ✗ Logging into 8 different dashboards to manage one business
- ✗ Paying multiple companies for features that overlap
- ✗ Troubleshooting integrations instead of serving clients
- ✗ Watching your margins shrink because of software bloat

Sound familiar?

**It's not your fault.**

The software industry WANTS you fragmented. Every company wants to own "one piece" of your business and charge you monthly for it.

They're not incentivized to give you everything in one place. That would mean fewer subscriptions. Less recurring revenue for them.

So they keep you trapped in what I call the **"Duct Tape Tech Stack"**—a Frankenstein's monster of tools barely held together by integrations that break at the worst possible moments.

And every month, you pay the price.

---

## What If There Was Another Way?

What if you could wake up tomorrow and log into ONE dashboard?

A dashboard where:
- Your funnels live
- Your email automation runs
- Your courses are hosted
- Your CRM tracks every lead
- Your webinars play automatically
- Your checkout processes payments
- Your affiliate program recruits partners
- Your community engages members
- Your calendar books appointments
- Your invoicing handles billing

All in one place. One login. One subscription.

What would that be worth to you?

What would it feel like to CANCEL all those other subscriptions?

To stop troubleshooting integrations and start building your business?

To keep more of what you earn instead of handing it to 10 different software companies?

**I'm not asking hypothetically.**

Because that platform exists.

And today, I'm offering it to you at a price that will make you question why you waited so long.

## Introducing Scale Plus: The Only True All-in-One Platform for Online Business Owners

Scale Plus isn't just another software tool.

It's the platform we built because we got tired of the same problems you're facing.

I'm Mike Filsaime. Over the past 20+ years, I've created software used by millions of people—Groove.cm, Groove.ai, Kartra, WebinarJam, EverWebinar, and Courses.gg.

I've been behind the scenes of this industry longer than most companies have existed.

And here's what I've learned:

**Most "all-in-one" platforms are lying to you.**

They call themselves all-in-one, but they're missing critical pieces. Or they nickel-and-dime you with add-ons. Or they charge enterprise prices that only big companies can afford.

We decided to do something different.

We decided to build a **true** all-in-one platform—one that includes EVERYTHING you need to run a digital marketing business, an agency, a coaching practice, or any online business.

And we decided to price it so affordably that no one could compete with us... and no customer would ever want to leave.

The result is **Scale Plus.**

---

## Let's Do the Math (This Is Where It Gets Ridiculous)

If you were to buy these tools separately, here's what you'd be looking at:

| Tool | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| ClickFunnels | $147 |
| Kajabi | $149 |
| GoHighLevel | $297 |
| ActiveCampaign | $49 |
| SamCart | $99 |
| EverWebinar | $42 (annual) |
| Calendly Pro | $12 |
| Skool | $99 |
| Various AI tools | $100+ |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,000+/month** |

That's **$12,000+ per year** for a fragmented tech stack that doesn't even work well together.

**With Scale Plus, you get ALL of this—and more—for $149/month.**

That's already **90% cheaper** than duct-taping everything together.

But today, I'm going to make this even easier for you...

## Your 2026 Fresh Start Offer: 70% Off Your First Year

Here's the deal:

You're reading this at the perfect time.

We want to help you start 2026 with a clean slate. No more tech chaos. No more subscription overload. No more wondering if your tools are going to break.

So for this week only, we're offering:

### **Scale Plus: $497 for your entire first year**

That's right. **$497 for 12 months.** Just $41.42/month.

That's **70% off** the regular $149/month price.

**You're saving $1,291 in your first year alone.**

After your first year, you'll continue at the regular $149/month—still a fraction of what you'd pay for separate tools.

But that first-year savings? It's yours to keep.

Think about what you could do with an extra $1,291:
- Invest in advertising to grow your business
- Pay yourself for once
- Take your family on a trip
- Hire a VA to handle the work you hate

That money stays in YOUR pocket instead of going to a dozen different software companies.

## "But Mike, How Do I Know This Will Work for Me?"

Fair question. Let me address that head-on.

**If you're a digital marketer** who sells courses, coaching, or digital products through funnels—Scale Plus was built for you. That's our core DNA.

**If you're an agency owner, coach, or consultant** who works with clients (not just customers)—we've expanded specifically for you. CRM, invoicing, calendar booking, client portals—everything you need to manage client relationships professionally.

**If you're just starting out** and don't want to waste money learning expensive platforms that do the same things—Scale Plus gives you everything you need from day one, at a price you can actually afford.

Over 100,000 entrepreneurs have used our platforms. We've been doing this for 20+ years. We're not going anywhere.

---

## What Makes Scale Plus Different (Why This Isn't "Just Another Platform")

Let me be direct about what sets us apart:

### 1. We're a TRUE All-in-One

Other platforms claim to be all-in-one, then charge extra for webinars, or don't have a real CRM, or can't handle courses, or lack AI tools.

Scale Plus includes **25+ applications** that actually do what they promise. No hidden upgrades. No missing pieces.

### 2. Our AI Integration Is Real

We're not just slapping "AI" on a marketing page. ClickCampaigns.ai, ChatBaser.ai, BrandBaser, HighTicketGPT, ScaleGPT—these are working applications that save hours of work every day.

While others talk about AI, we've built it into the platform.

### 3. Our Pricing Is Unbeatable (And We Want It That Way)

Most platforms charge $200-$500/month and still nickel-and-dime you.

We chose to price Scale Plus at $149/month (and $497/year with this offer) because we believe the best way to build a lasting company is to make our customers never want to leave.

If you're paying us $41/month and getting $1,000/month worth of value, why would you ever switch?

### 4. Everything Actually Works Together

No Zapier. No API headaches. No praying integrations don't break.

Every tool in Scale Plus was designed to work with every other tool. Your funnel connects to your email. Your email connects to your CRM. Your CRM connects to your calendar. Seamlessly.

## The Real Cost of Waiting

Let me paint two pictures for you:

**Picture #1: You Take Action Today**

You join Scale Plus. You save $1,291 in your first year. You cancel 5-10 other subscriptions. You finally have ONE dashboard. Your business runs smoother. You have more time. You have more money. 2026 becomes the year everything clicked.

**Picture #2: You Wait**

You keep paying for tools that don't work together. You keep troubleshooting integrations. You keep logging into multiple dashboards. You keep watching your margins shrink. Six months from now, you're in the same place—except you've spent another $6,000+ on software.

Which picture do you want?

---

## This Offer Won't Last

I need to be straight with you:

The 70% off pricing ($497/year) is a limited-time offer for 2026.

We're doing this because we want to start the year strong and help as many entrepreneurs as possible escape the subscription trap.

But we can't offer this forever. It's not sustainable at this price.

When this offer ends, the price goes back to $149/month.

If you're reading this and the button below still works, you're in luck.

If it doesn't... I'm sorry. You'll have to wait for the next promotion—or pay full price.

Don't let that happen.

---

## Ready to Make 2026 Different?

You've seen what Scale Plus offers.

You've done the math.

You've understood what's at stake.

Now it's decision time.

**Option A:** Close this page and go back to the duct-tape tech stack. Keep paying. Keep troubleshooting. Keep hoping something changes.

**Option B:** Click the button below. Join Scale Plus for $497/year. Start 2026 with a clean slate, a unified platform, and an extra $1,291 in your pocket.

The choice is yours.

But if you're ready to stop the software chaos and finally run your business like a pro...

To your success in 2026 and beyond,

**Mike Filsaime**
Founder, Scale Plus

P.S. — Remember: You're protected by our 30-day money-back guarantee. Try Scale Plus risk-free. If it's not everything I've promised, you get a full refund. But I'm confident once you see how much easier your business becomes, you'll never look back.

P.P.S. — This 70% off offer ($497/year) is only available during this launch window. After that, it's $149/month. If you've been paying attention, you know that's still a great deal—but why pay more when you can lock in the savings today?

P.P.P.S. — Still on the fence? Consider this: Every month you wait, you're spending $800-$1,500 on separate tools. That's money you'll never get back. Join now, cancel those subscriptions, and let the savings start immediately.
