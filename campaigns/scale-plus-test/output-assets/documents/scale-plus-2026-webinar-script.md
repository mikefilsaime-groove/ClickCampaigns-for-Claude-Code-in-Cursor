## SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION & HOOK (0:00-10:00)

### Slide 2: Title Slide
**[ON SCREEN: "Make 2026 Your AI-Powered Marketing Suite Year"]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Hey everyone, welcome! I'm so glad you're here. Before we dive in, I want to ask you a quick question—type your answer in the chat:

"How much are you paying PER MONTH for all your software subscriptions combined?"

Just take a guess. Funnel builder, email, courses, CRM, calendar, checkout—add it all up. What's that number?

*Wait for responses*

I'm seeing $200... $500... $800... $1,200...

If you're anywhere in that range, you're going to want to pay close attention today. Because what I'm about to show you could cut that number by 90%.

---

### Slide 3: The Promise
**[ON SCREEN: "What You'll Discover Today"]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Over the next 60 minutes, I'm going to show you:

1. Why the "duct-tape tech stack" is costing you more than just money—it's costing you time, energy, and growth
2. The NEW model that the smartest entrepreneurs are switching to in 2026
3. The exact platform I built that lets you run your ENTIRE business from one dashboard
4. And a special offer that's only available to people on this webinar

Now, I know you're busy. You have things to do. So I promise to make this worth your time.

If you stay until the end, you'll have complete clarity on whether this is right for you—and if it is, you'll have an opportunity to get started at the best price we've ever offered.

Fair enough? Type "YES" in the chat if you're ready to dive in.

---

### Slide 4: Who Am I?
**[ON SCREEN: Mike Filsaime photo + credentials]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
For those who don't know me, my name is Mike Filsaime.

I've been building software for online entrepreneurs for over 20 years.

You might know some of the platforms I've created:
- Groove.cm
- Kartra
- WebinarJam
- EverWebinar
- Courses.gg

These tools have been used by millions of people to build their online businesses.

I've spoken on stages around the world, been part of masterminds with the biggest names in digital marketing, and my products have generated over $100 million in sales.

But here's what's important: I'm not telling you this to brag. I'm telling you this so you know that what I'm about to share comes from decades of experience on BOTH sides—building the tools AND using them.

---

### Slide 5: My Story - The Before
**[ON SCREEN: "I Know What You're Going Through"]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Because here's the thing—I've been where you are.

Before I was a software creator, I was a software USER. I was the guy duct-taping together different platforms. Paying for multiple subscriptions. Praying the integrations wouldn't break.

And I remember the frustration.

The moment your funnel stops working because Zapier glitched.

The feeling when you realize you're paying $1,500 a month for tools that SHOULD work together but don't.

The exhaustion of logging into 8 different dashboards just to manage one business.

I built the platforms I built because I wanted to SOLVE these problems. First for myself. Then for everyone else.

---

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (10:00-20:00)

### Slide 6: The Duct Tape Tech Stack
**[ON SCREEN: Spider web of logos - ClickFunnels, Kajabi, ActiveCampaign, etc.]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let's talk about what I call the "Duct Tape Tech Stack."

This is what most online business owners are dealing with right now.

You have:
- ClickFunnels or Kartra for your funnels
- ActiveCampaign or ConvertKit for email
- Kajabi or Teachable for courses
- GoHighLevel or HubSpot for your CRM
- Calendly for scheduling
- SamCart for checkout
- Zoom or Demio for webinars
- Skool for community

Each tool does ONE thing. And you're trying to make them all work together.

It's like building a house where the electrician, plumber, and carpenter don't speak the same language and weren't given the same blueprints.

---

### Slide 7: The True Cost
**[ON SCREEN: Cost breakdown table]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let's add up what this actually costs:

- ClickFunnels: $147/month
- Kajabi: $149/month
- GoHighLevel: $297/month
- ActiveCampaign: $49/month
- SamCart: $99/month
- Calendly Pro: $12/month
- EverWebinar: $42/month (broken down)
- Skool: $99/month

That's over $1,000 per month. $12,000+ per year.

Type in the chat: Is your number close to this? Higher? Lower?

---

### Slide 8: The Hidden Costs
**[ON SCREEN: "It's Not Just Money..."]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
But here's what nobody talks about.

The money is just the beginning. The HIDDEN costs are even worse:

**Time:** How many hours do you spend managing these tools? Setting up integrations? Troubleshooting when things break? Watching tutorials for 8 different platforms?

**Energy:** The mental load of switching between dashboards. The stress of wondering if your systems are working.

**Growth:** Every hour you spend on tech is an hour you're NOT spending on strategy, content, or serving clients.

**Opportunities:** The campaigns you didn't launch because the tech was too complicated. The features you couldn't use because your tools didn't talk to each other.

This is what the duct-tape tech stack really costs. And it's far more than $12,000 a year.

---

### Slide 9: Why It's Not Your Fault
**[ON SCREEN: "The System Was Designed This Way"]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Now here's what I want you to understand:

This is NOT your fault.

You did what everyone told you to do. You bought the tools the gurus recommended. You set up the tech stack the courses said to set up.

The problem is... the SOFTWARE INDUSTRY wants you fragmented.

Think about it.

ClickFunnels makes money when you pay them for funnels.
Kajabi makes money when you pay them for courses.
ActiveCampaign makes money when you pay them for email.

None of these companies are incentivized to give you EVERYTHING in one place. That would mean you'd stop paying all of them.

So they each build their piece... and let YOU figure out how to connect it all.

It's a brilliant business model—for them.

For you? It's expensive, frustrating, and holding you back.

---

### Slide 10: The Breaking Point
**[ON SCREEN: "There Has to Be a Better Way"]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
At some point, every successful entrepreneur hits a breaking point.

They look at their monthly credit card statement and see 10 different software charges.

They spend an entire afternoon troubleshooting why leads aren't syncing between their funnel and their CRM.

They realize they're spending more time managing tools than actually building their business.

And they think: "There HAS to be a better way."

If you've ever had that thought... today is your answer.

---

## SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION (20:00-35:00)

### Slide 11: The New Model
**[ON SCREEN: "One Platform. Everything You Need."]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
The better way is what I call the "Unified Platform Model."

Instead of 10 tools that barely work together...

You have ONE platform that does everything.

Built by one team. With one vision. Designed to work together from the ground up.

No integrations. No Zapier. No praying things don't break.

Just one dashboard with everything you need.

---

### Slide 12: Introducing Scale Plus
**[ON SCREEN: Scale Plus logo]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
This is what we built with Scale Plus.

Scale Plus is the only TRUE all-in-one platform for online business owners.

I say "true" because a lot of platforms claim to be all-in-one... but they're missing key pieces. Or they charge extra for features that should be included. Or they're so expensive that only enterprise companies can afford them.

Scale Plus is different.

25+ integrated applications. One platform. One price.

Let me show you exactly what's inside.

---

### Slide 13: The Groove.cm Foundation
**[ON SCREEN: Groove.cm features grid]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
The foundation of Scale Plus is Groove.cm—our complete marketing suite.

**GrooveFunnels** - Build complete sales funnels. Landing pages, upsells, downsells, order bumps. Everything flows together.

**GroovePages** - Drag-and-drop website builder. Beautiful templates. SEO built in.

**GrooveSell** - Checkout system with zero transaction fees. Maximize every sale.

**GrooveMail** - Email marketing with automation, tagging, segmentation.

And that's just the marketing foundation.

---

### Slide 14: AI-Powered Tools
**[ON SCREEN: AI tools showcase]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Here's where it gets really exciting.

Scale Plus includes AI-powered tools that didn't exist even two years ago.

**ClickCampaigns.ai** - Tell the AI what you're selling. It creates complete campaigns. Ad copy. Email sequences. Landing pages. In minutes, not days.

**ChatBaser.ai** - Train a chatbot on YOUR business. Answer customer questions. Capture leads. Book appointments. All automatically, 24/7.

**BrandBaser** - Generate on-brand content. Sales pages, emails, social posts—all matching your voice.

**HighTicketGPT** - Write VSL scripts and webinar presentations using proven frameworks.

**ScaleGPT** - Build custom AI assistants for your business.

These tools give you an unfair advantage. While your competitors are spending hours creating content... you're generating it in minutes.

---

### Slide 15: CRM & Business Operations
**[ON SCREEN: CRM and business tools]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
For those of you who work with CLIENTS—not just customers—we've got you covered.

**PipeLeads.ai CRM** - Full sales pipeline management. Track every lead, every deal, every touchpoint.

**PipeLeads.ai LeadFinder** - Find your ideal prospects. Search by industry, title, location. AI writes your outreach.

This is everything an agency owner, coach, or consultant needs to run a professional operation.

---

### Slide 16: Email Partnership
**[ON SCREEN: TinyEmail partnership]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
And because email deliverability matters, we've partnered with TinyEmail.

Scale Plus members get:

**Free Plan:** 15,000 emails per month for up to 500 contacts—completely FREE. That's a $65/month value.

**Upgraded Plan:** 200,000 emails per month with unlimited contacts for just $14.97/month. Normally $450/month. That's 96% off.

Enterprise-level email at a fraction of the cost.

---

### Slide 17: Everything Together
**[ON SCREEN: All 25+ apps in a grid]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let me put this all together.

25+ applications. One platform. One login.

Everything designed to work together because it was BUILT together.

Your funnel connects to your email. Your email connects to your CRM. Your CRM connects to your calendar. Seamlessly.

No integrations to set up. No Zapier to configure. No things breaking at 2am.

Just one unified system for running your entire online business.

Type "ALL IN ONE" in the chat if this is what you've been looking for.

---

## SECTION 4: PROOF & CASE STUDIES (35:00-42:00)

### Slide 18: Who This Works For
**[ON SCREEN: Three audience avatars]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Now you might be wondering: "Is this for me?"

Scale Plus is designed for three types of entrepreneurs:

**1. Digital Marketers** - Course creators, info product sellers, anyone who sells through funnels and automation. You need pages, email, checkout, courses, webinars—all in one place.

**2. Client Service Professionals** - Coaches, consultants, agency owners. You need CRM, invoicing, scheduling, lead generation. Plus the marketing tools to attract clients.

**3. New Entrepreneurs** - People just getting started who don't want to waste money learning expensive tools. Start with everything you need at a price you can afford.

If you're in any of these categories, Scale Plus was built for you.

---

### Slide 19: Case Study 1
**[ON SCREEN: Marc's story]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let me share some real results.

Marc was running a digital marketing business using five different platforms. ClickFunnels, ActiveCampaign, Teachable, Calendly, and SamCart.

He was paying over $600 a month. Spending hours managing integrations. Constantly worried something would break.

He switched to Scale Plus. Within two weeks, he had consolidated everything into one dashboard.

His software costs dropped by 80%.

But more importantly—he got his TIME back. He's no longer playing tech support. He's actually growing his business.

---

### Slide 20: Case Study 2
**[ON SCREEN: Robyn's story]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Robyn is an executive coach.

Before Scale Plus, she was drowning in admin. Manually sending follow-ups. Tracking clients in spreadsheets. Chasing invoices.

She set up Scale Plus with automated client onboarding, recurring invoicing, and a funnel that generates leads while she sleeps.

Her words: "I finally feel like I'm running my business instead of my business running me."

She's now signing clients faster and spending less time on busywork.

---

### Slide 21: Case Study 3
**[ON SCREEN: Tom's story]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Tom runs a marketing agency. He was skeptical because he'd been burned by "all-in-one" platforms before.

He gave Scale Plus a shot. Within two weeks, his entire team had migrated.

They use the CRM for client management. The invoicing for billing. The email for outreach. The funnels for lead generation.

Tom told me: "This is the first platform that actually delivers on the all-in-one promise."

---

### Slide 22: By The Numbers
**[ON SCREEN: Statistics]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
These aren't isolated cases.

- Over 100,000 entrepreneurs have used our platforms
- 20+ years of software development experience
- Millions of dollars processed through our checkout systems
- Thousands of courses hosted on our membership platform

This isn't new. This isn't untested. This is proven technology, refined over two decades.

---

## SECTION 5: THE OFFER (42:00-52:00)

### Slide 23: Let's Talk Price
**[ON SCREEN: "What Would All This Be Worth?"]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
So let's talk about what this is worth.

If you bought these tools separately—the funnels, email, courses, CRM, webinars, checkout, AI tools—you'd be paying at least $1,000 per month. $12,000+ per year.

Scale Plus gives you all of this for $149 per month.

That's already an incredible deal. You're saving over $10,000 a year just by switching.

But today... I'm not going to charge you $149 a month.

---

### Slide 24: The 2026 Fresh Start Offer
**[ON SCREEN: "$497 for Your Entire First Year"]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Because you showed up for this webinar... because you're taking action at the start of 2026... because I want to help you start the year with a clean slate...

I'm offering Scale Plus for **$497 for your entire first year.**

That's it. $497. One payment. Full access for 12 months.

That's 70% off the regular price.

Just $41.42 per month.

---

### Slide 25: The Savings
**[ON SCREEN: Savings calculation]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let me show you what you're saving.

Regular price: $149/month = $1,788/year

Your price today: $497/year

**You save $1,291 in year one.**

Compared to separate tools at $1,000+/month?

**You could save over $10,000.**

After year one, you continue at $149/month—still a fraction of what separate tools cost.

But that first-year discount? It's yours to keep.

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Here's why I'm doing this right now.

2026 is going to be a pivotal year for online business. AI is changing everything. The entrepreneurs who have the right tools—the unified, AI-powered tools—are going to pull ahead.

The only risk is NOT taking action and spending another year overpaying for tools that don't work together.

---

### Slide 31: FAQ
**[ON SCREEN: Common Questions]**

**SPEAKER NOTES:**
Let me answer some quick questions:

**"How long does it take to set up?"**

Yes. We have migration tools and support to help you move pages, contacts, and courses.

**"What if I need help?"**
We have full support, tutorials, and a community of other Scale Plus members.

**"Is this really a one-time payment for the year?"**
Yes. $497 covers your full first year. After that, $149/month—still way cheaper than alternatives.

**"What's the catch?"**
No catch. We make money when you succeed and stay with us. So we built something that actually delivers value.
